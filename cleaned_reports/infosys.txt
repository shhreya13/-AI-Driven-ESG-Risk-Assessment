Introduction	
As the climate crisis escalates, the call for institutions to act is no longer a nudge
- it is a demand. Infosys' journey towards sustainability began in the early 2000s. Over the years, our efforts have created real impact across our value chain, clients, and communities.
Today, there is no doubt that we are in the midst of a global phenomenon, moving towards an AI-first future, and the stakes have never been higher. For us, this isn't just about keeping pace. It is about building AI infrastructure and data strategies that are fair, transparent, and deeply responsible. We are
leveraging these capabilities not only to advance our own sustainability goals, but to create enterprise-scale value for our clients in ways that are future-ready and impact-driven.

Sustaining the momentum of carbon neutrality for six years, our next frontier is becoming climate positive in 2030, and we are engineering the path with precision. Backed by our net zero commitment, we are using smart systems to forecast risks, chart the way forward, and take decisive action. In fiscal 2025, at the halfway mark, we share some of these journeys with you in this ESG report, proof of what is possible when purpose meets action, as we continue to move ahead, mining insights to deliver impact.

We achieved carbon neutrality in 2020.
Our next frontier is to become climate positive in 2030, engineering the path with precision.


				


Message from the CFO	
Dear stakeholder,

We live and work in the era of Artificial Intelligence. Extreme automation, intensely data-driven decisions, personalization made possible by deep analytics, and intelligent systems mark our experiences at work and outside. Naturally, this also brings with it the need to consider the
complexities of data privacy, digital equity, and the ethics of AI. The need of the hour is to harness the opportunity to progress but to do so while being mindful of ESG considerations. With this in mind, we have strengthened our ESG strategy to be more intentional, forward-looking, and purposeful. We undertook a refresh of our ESG Vision 2030 and ambitions thereof to further sharpen our focus. Our purpose - "To amplify human potential and create the next opportunity for people, businesses, and communities" - continues to be our guiding light. A future-ready ESG roadmap is the result, designed to lead responsibly in an increasingly self-running world.
Our organization's core ESG tenets were actively integrated into Infosys' operations and decision-making processes throughout fiscal 2025. This has been widely recognized and applauded.
For the sixth consecutive year, we are carbon neutral across our global operations, by reducing our energy consumption, increasing our renewable energy sourcing, and offsetting our residual emissions through high-quality carbon credits.
We have been recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies, for the fifth year in a row, by Ethisphere.

Infosys also became the first India-headquartered Company to receive Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) approval from EU data protection authorities. This was a significant milestone for us, demonstrating our commitment to data privacy and compliance with EU regulations.
We have reached 13.3 million people with digital skills, including employees, clients' workforce, students, teachers, and communities. 175,000 patients have been onboarded to SightConnect, making eye care more accessible to all.
You will see more details as you join us in reviewing this ESG Report. As always, we invite your feedback.

Our ESG Priorities	
Every view matters
Infosys has a presence across multiple geographies, industries, services and products. The universe of our material matters is complex and multi-layered, one that is deeply intertwined with the decisions we implement and the value we seek to create through our business. Within the domains of E, S and G, we are constantly thinking about issues in an ever-changing and dynamic world and preparing for them.

In 2020, we undertook a review of the progress we made over the past decade on our sustainability goals and developed the lens further in a more practical and comprehensive manner, to broaden our ESG focus and rank our priorities in order of their importance to our business and our stakeholders.


Our approach
We determined our most material issues through a data-driven and consultative exercise. Material topics were shortlisted and prioritized based on their impact on our stakeholders and our business.

• Investor priorities through investor surveys
• Global indices reporting and assessment frameworks, thought papers1, and partnerships with globalorganization2
• Peer benchmarking in the IT industry
• Media and public opinion, using AI tools for insights


• Belief audits with the Management to understand priorities• Regulatory landscape
in jurisdictions relevant for Infosys
• Broader stakeholder consultations
• Specific ESG impact areas in geographical and service line contexts in relation to mega trends• Benchmarking against best practices among peers in IT and other industries
• Employee engagement surveys, focus group discussions and Interactions1 World Economic Forum (www.weforum.org/whitepapers/toward-common-metrics-and-consistent-reporting-of-sustainable- value-creation)

Stakeholder engagement
We identify and prioritize our stakeholders based on the impact of the Company on the stakeholders and the ability of the stakeholder groups to influence the functioning of the Company. As part of the materiality assessment, we have identified six key stakeholder group: Inverstors / shareholders, clients, employees and sub-contractors, suppliers / partners, government / regulators, and the community.





				



ESG Vision 2030 Refresh
Being the mid-point in our journey to realize our ESG Vision 2030, 2025 was a good time to reflect on our progress while reviewing our material topics for their continued relevance to growing stakeholder expectations. This detailed exercise resulted in crafting our roadmap towards a climate positive future where we envisage being net zero in 2030 while staying true to our commitment to be carbon neutral every year. Our digital skilling efforts are now focused on enabling skilling for


Double Materiality Assessment


jobs while we amplify communities through Tech for Good initiatives, job creation, and CSR efforts including employee volunteering, healthcare interventions, and women's empowerment. We will nurture workplace inclusivity while aiming to be the employer of choice in the regions we operate. Our commitment to responsible governance remains steadfast as we shape thinking in data privacy and information management and lead best practice.

Our refreshed ESG Vision 2030 ambitions came into effect starting April 1, 2025.


1. Value chain identification
Our value chain encompasses the activities, resources and relationships used and relied on to deliver our services. Identifying and mapping Infosys' value chain was the foundation in the double materiality assessment process. This helped us identify where the most significant ESG IROs occur in our operations, and across our upstream and downstream value chain. Our key upstream partners include IT & services and
manpower suppliers, while our customers are the key downstream partners.

2. Determine ESG matters
We considered all ESRS-relevant sustainability


prioritized our stakeholders based on those who might be impacted by our activities and those who could influence our functioning.
As part of the materiality assessment, we have identified six key stakeholders: employees and sub-contractors, clients, investor/shareholders, suppliers/partners, government/regulators, and communities. Due to the diverse nature
of the stakeholder groups, we use different channels of consultation and engagement regarding a range of topics, including ESG. For the double materiality assessment, we refined our list of identified IROs through consultations with internal stakeholders, including the ESG Ambition owners and the ESG Council.

This year, we undertook a double materiality assessment in advance of our reporting commitment to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). We leveraged our Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI)-based material topics to identify material sustainability-related matters using the double materiality framework guided by recommendations of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), marking a key milestone
in the advancement of our readiness towards compliance with EU CSRD. The double materialty assessment identified ESG matters that are material to Infosys based on potential and actual Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities (IROs). We will continue to monitor the directive and revisit our double materiality assessment to ensure it reflects evolving regulatory requirements as well as changes to our business. This exercise has been reviewed and approved by the Board.
Our approach
We adopted a research-backed consultative approach grounded in analytics. Material ESG matters were seeded and ranked based on criteria defined for impact materiality - the positive and negative ESG-related impacts connected to the business - and financial materiality - the ESG-related financial risks and opportunities.

topics, sub-topics, and sub-sub-topics. Further, we identified relevant ESG matters across our value chain through a comprehensive review of our existing ESG priorities, our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system, key priorities for stakeholders, and other evolving priorities in the sector.

3. Identify impacts, risks and opportunities Built on the list of previously identified ESG matters material to Infosys, we developed a list of IROs, to be further used as the base for the double materiality assessment. To ensure we fully integrated the financial and risk perspective, we considered the enterprise-wide risk register results as part of the process. Further, we reviewed several industry reports as well as academic research papers.

4. Stakeholder engagement
In carrying out the double materiality assessment, engagement with stakeholders both internal as well as external has helped us prioritize the IROs. We have identified and


5. Determine impact and financial materiality
We used an average scoring approach, and the impacts were assessed based on their scale, scope, irremediability (in the case of negative impacts) and likelihood; and risks and opportunities on their magnitude and likelihood. The likelihood was calculated only for material IROs.

Impact materiality score: The procedure to establish impact materiality was principally aligned with the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group's (EFRAG) implementation guideline, assessing scale, scope and irremediability. For scale, we assessed the size of the impact on the environment and people; for scope, its reach
or geographical span, and, where applicable, irremediability scores considered efforts that might be needed to remediate our negative impacts.

Financial materiality score: The risks and opportunities were assessed based on their


				



likelihood of occurrence and the potential magnitude of their financial effects in the short-,medium- and long-term. The likelihood was assessed on the probability of the risk or opportunity materializing (e.g., almost certain, likely, possible, unlikely), while magnitude was
based on the significance of the financial effect if this risk or opportunity were to materialize (e.g., above or below the threshold). The procedure to determine financial materiality was fundamentally aligned with Infosys' enterprise risk management framework.

Threshold was selected using a qualitative and quantitative method, based on the topic's alignment with Infosys' strategy and risk approach, continuity with previous materiality assessments, and relevance of the information to the value chain partners.
6. 
Finalize material matters and reporting obligations
The preliminary results of IRO scores were aggregated, deliberated, and validated at workshops with ESG Ambition leaders at Infosys and by the ESG Council. The workshops were conducted to include a top-down perspective and prevent subjective bias. We analyzed all the impacts and financial results to build a prioritized list of material matters. We defined the threshold for prioritization to highlight ESG matters that came extremely high on either an impact or financial perspective or both. We mapped the material IROs to the existing GRI disclosures and applicable ESRS data points.

Infosys' pledge: Climate Positive in 2030	

Infosys recognizes that climate change is more than an environmental challenge-it is a fundamental issue that affects economies, communities, and the way we live and work. As our business expands across regions, we are aware that growth goes hand in hand with responsibility. Expansion brings with it increased carbon emissions, resource consumption, and environmental pressure. That is why, we have embedded sustainability into the core of our operations through smarter design, adoption of clean energy, carbon offset initiatives, and biodiversity enhancement programs. Our ambition doesn't stop at mitigation. We are working towards climate positivity, aiming to restore more than we consume, and contribute actively to the health of our ecosystems and communities. We are implementing large-scale agroforestry projects across several states in India. This shift towards climate positivity reflects our belief that the true measure of success lies not only in growth, but also in how much we give back. By aligning our business
strategy with climate resilience and long-term environmental stewardship, we are building value-for our stakeholders, society, and future generations.

Two pathways, one ambition
Our approach to becoming climate positive focuses on transformational actions that address emissions at their source, leveraging innovative technologies and collaborative ecosystems. Two key pathways enable us.


Institutional Climate Action
By driving change across our operations, we aim to create a positive, scalable impact. Through granular emissions analysis across multiple areas, we have developed targeted, innovative solutions to drive meaningful reductions and make significant strides towards our climate positive ambitions.
Ecosystem Transformation
By enabling our suppliers and impacting the communities we are associated with, we proactively engage across the value chain. We advocate
for ecosystem-wide transformation by building awareness, sharing knowledge, and uniting diverse stakeholders to accelerate collective progress.



















Infosys Kolkata campus


• Transition to cleaner fuels with biodiesel blends, CNG / LPG, EVs, and battery-powered systems.
• Replace R22 refrigerants with low- GWP sustainable alternatives.


• Drive energy efficiency through deep retrofits and targeted energy audits.
• Expand renewable energy via green tariffs and onsite generation.


• Decarbonize the supply chain through supplier disclosures, EPDs, and low-carbon sourcing.
• Promote low-carbon mobility via virtual collaboration, public
transport, and EV campus transport.


		



Greener by design: Reimagining infrastructure and buildings
Globally, buildings contribute nearly 40% of GHG emissions. For Infosys, they represent the most energy-intensive asset class, and therefore, the most powerful lever for emissions reduction. All new developments are designed to achieve the highest level of LEED certifications, with over 29.7 million sq. ft. of green-certified buildings already operational. From design to operation, we adopt
a lifecycle approach to emissions, maximizing efficiency at every stage. By integrating low-carbon strategies into design, material selection, and construction practices, we create buildings that are resource-efficient.

Greener cooling
Solidifying its ongoing commitment to sustainability and innovation, Infosys continues to adopt advanced technologies that reduce environmental impact
and optimize operational efficiency. Our Indore campus is now home to Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO)


HFO Chiller, Infosys Indore campus


magnetic chillers, marking a significant step in climate-conscious cooling. HFOs offer a responsible alternative to traditional refrigerants, while magnetic chiller technology boosts energy efficiency and reduces operating costs. Building on this success,
Infosys plans to expand the use of HFO chillers to its Noida and Hyderabad campuses. In parallel, all critical air-conditioning units at the Bengaluru
campus have been upgraded to R-22-free systems.

Water-efficient construction
We also emphasize resource conservation during construction, by using water-efficient curing compounds that reduce consumption and environmental load.

Post-tensioned (PT) slabs decrease concrete and steel use, cutting embodied carbon and enhancing




Reducing embodied carbon
Infosys continues to embed lifecycle thinking into the design and construction of its campuses, ensuring that our built infrastructure aligns with our climate goals. In FY 2023-24, we undertook cradle- to-grave Life Cycle Assessments (LCA, A1- C4 stages) for new buildings in our Pune, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru campuses to measure embodied carbon and identify optimization opportunities across the building lifecycle.












Infosys Pune campus



The assessments revealed that the highest environmental impact occurred during the product stage (A1-A3)-driven primarily by emissions from concrete
and reinforced steel used in horizontal structures such as beams and slabs. For instance, embodied carbon intensity ranged from 616 to 651 kg CO2e/m², with concrete and steel accounting for up to 80% of material-related emissions in some sites. To mitigate this, we piloted multiple material optimization strategies. In Hyderabad, replacing 50% of cement with GGBFS reduced embodied carbon intensity by 15.8%. In Pune, using 30% recycled content in concrete and 15% in steel reinforcements achieved a total reduction of 11.2%.
Looking ahead, we are exploring further interventions such as high-recycled- content aluminum façades, low-carbon glass, increased fly ash in AAC blocks, and emerging low-impact alternatives like agrocrete and green steel.


		




structural efficiency. Ready-mix or gypsum plasters ensure quality, reduce waste, and lower emissions through controlled application. Through these integrated efforts, we are not just building sustainably-we are redefining what responsible construction looks like in a net zero future.
Renewable energy
Infosys was the first Indian Company to pledge commitment to RE100 in 2015. Over the years, we have ramped up our efforts towards our renewable energy goals. We source renewable energy through a diversified mix of captive solar plants, onsite installations, and strategic green energy procurement mechanisms.

• Infosys operates captive renewable energy plants with a combined capacity of 60 megawatts (MW), which form a significant component of our clean energy mix. These plants play a pivotal role in reducing our dependence on grid electricity and ensuring a steady, self-sustained supply of green power across key campuses.
• To further scale our renewable energy portfolio, we are actively leveraging Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and procuring green power through government-supported green tariff mechanisms offered by Distribution Companies (DISCOMs). These arrangements are instrumental in expanding our access to clean energy beyond our own generation capacity.
• In addition, we have made extensive investments in rooftop and ground-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) systems across our infrastructure. These installations are now present in 100% of our owned campuses. This wide deployment of onsite

Approach to tackle Scope 3
Tackling Scope 3 emissions is critical to Infosys' journey towards becoming climate positive. Our strategy goes beyond measurement by focusing on supplier collaboration, low-carbon procurement, sustainable employee mobility, and circularity in operations. From business travel to capital goods and work-from-home emissions, we are embedding climate action across our extended ecosystem with a focus on emissions in the following categories:
• Sustainable mobility
• Business travel
• Waste
• Work from home
• Upstream leased assets
• Transmission and distribution loss
• Capital goods

Sustainable mobility
Employee transportation accounts for a significant portion of our indirect emissions. At our Bengaluru headquarters, we are collaborating with local authorities to extend metro connectivity to
our campus while promoting public transport alternatives. Our comprehensive commute survey provided valuable data on travel patterns, enabling targeted emission reduction strategies. We have introduced EV buses for employee commute and installed 1,325 EV charging points across campuses, powered by renewable energy.

Business travel
We are actively addressing travel emissions through multiple initiatives, implementing flexible work policies to reduce travel needs, promoting




carpooling and public transport, and transitioning to an electric vehicle fleet. Enhanced tracking methodologies now capture all transportation modes for more accurate emissions reporting.
These measures not only lower our carbon footprint but also contribute to solving urban challenges like traffic congestion.

Waste
Our comprehensive waste strategy focuses on reduction, reuse and recycling, resulting in waste emissions dropping in FY25. Through facility-wide segregation programs and employee engagement initiatives, we have significantly increased recyclable material recovery while minimizing landfill waste.
Digital transformation efforts have further reduced paper consumption across operations.

Work from home
With remote work now prevalent, we have implemented policies and training to reduce its environmental impact, which has enabled us to achieve a reduction in work-from-home emissions this year. Energy efficiency guidance

for home offices and virtual collaboration tools help minimize our remote work footprint while maintaining productivity.

Upstream leased assets
We rigorously assess landlords and partners to ensure leased properties meet our stringent sustainability standards. Advanced building management systems and energy-efficient technologies are deployed to minimize energy consumption across all leased spaces.

Transmission and distribution losses
Through operational optimization and partnerships with energy providers, we are improving grid efficiency to reduce transmission losses. Energy conservation measures across all facilities complement these efforts to minimize our electricity footprint.


Capital goods
Our sustainable procurement framework evaluates suppliers based on environmental performance, prioritizing durable, recyclable products. This approach has already yielded reductions in capital goods emissions this fiscal year while promoting circular economy principles.


		


Value chain decarbonization:
A collaborative climate strategy
With nearly 30% of our emissions linked to capital goods, decarbonizing our supply chain is a key priority. Infosys engages a wide range of partners, including OEMs, aggregators, contractors, and consultants, to tackle Scope 3 emissions through measurement, and more so, by driving behavior change, building capacity, and raising climate ambition. Through strategic collaborations, we are advancing low-carbon, sustainable practices across our value chain.

Engaging suppliers
As climate-related performance becomes a competitive differentiator, clients increasingly include Infosys' climate credentials in Requests For Proposals (RFPs) and procurement decisions, reflecting the market-wide pivot towards sustainable partnerships. Infosys is committed to raising this bar within its own supply chain,
ensuring that suppliers not only meet compliance requirements but actively contribute to emissions reduction. Our approach is guided by an integrated climate governance framework. Together, these measures are creating a supplier ecosystem
that is climate-resilient, regulation-ready, and future-facing, reflecting Infosys' vision of shared sustainability leadership.


In FY 2024, Infosys launched a strategic initiative to accelerate decarbonization in its supply chain, focusing on key IT hardware manufacturing suppliers, prioritized by spend. This initiative focused on securing detailed, forward-looking decarbonization roadmaps from these partners.

Carbon offsets and clean energy access
Since 2016, Infosys has actively pursued impactful carbon reduction projects across India, focusing on energy access for rural communities. Through 10 ongoing initiatives, including improved cookstoves and household biogas systems, we are delivering cleaner, more efficient energy to over 2,72,000 families, transforming lives and reducing emissions. We observed our biogas projects empower women in rural India, who utilize
biogas slurry to cultivate thriving kitchen gardens and vegetable farms, enhancing food security and generating income. Such successes across numerous villages underscore the multifaceted

positive impact of our energy projects on farming communities.
Moving towards greater environmental impacts
To further our positive impact on the environment through our projects, we recognize that a comprehensive climate strategy necessitates removing existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This understanding has led us to strategically integrate agroforestry projects into our climate action portfolio. Recognizing the challenges posed by traditional farming practices and climate change-including soil degradation,

reduced productivity, and economic instability for small and marginal farmers-we are committed to fostering sustainable agricultural practices that
directly remove CO2 from the atmosphere through carbon sequestration.

Agroforestry, by integrating trees, shrubs, and crops, offers a transformative approach to enhance ecosystem services, diversify income streams, and climate-proof farm livelihoods. These projects will directly contribute to the removal of atmospheric CO2.

Our proposed multilayer agroforestry initiatives

aim to restore degraded lands and uplift rural communities through sustainable agricultural practices. We commenced the agroforestry projects in FY2025 and planted about 4,07,000 saplings. By embracing agroforestry projects, Infosys is reinforcing its commitment to long-term sustainability, creating resilient communities,
and directly contributing to the removal of atmospheric CO2, complementing our ongoing efforts to reduce our operational footprint. This strategic evolution from emissions reduction
to CO2 removal underscores our dedication to comprehensive climate action.

Water	
Water is fast becoming one of the most critical sustainability challenges, shaping global conversations around climate resilience, biodiversity preservation, and human well-being. Many of our campuses are located in regions already facing significant water stress. Recognizing this early, Infosys understood that its responsibility must extend beyond operational efficiency. Aligned with our climate-positive goals, we continue to be committed to reducing our water footprint and enhancing water availability in the communities where we operate. The growing global water crisis, coupled with the critical role of water in sustaining our operations, workforce, and surrounding communities, made water stewardship a clear and pressing area of focus.

By 2030, 50% of the global population is projected to face water scarcity, and we have been acting on this for more than two decades. Infosys endorsed the UN Global Compact's CEO Water Mandate in 2014, ratifying its commitment to "zero wastewater discharge", and we have maintained zero wastewater discharge across our campuses. This has since evolved into a pioneering water stewardship model. Over the last decade, Infosys has moved from water-efficient campus design to institutionalizing a model of water stewardship-one that regenerates ecosystems, safeguards community water security, and sets benchmarks for the IT sector.

As part of the climate-positive initiatives, Infosys plans to recharge more than its consumption (fresh water and treated water) and unit intensity across its operations.

Our approach

Reducing our water footprint
We continue to work towards reducing our water consumption through demand reduction measures.
These include low-flow fixtures, sensor-based taps, pressure compensating valves and aerators, and smart water metering. Our new buildings are
designed for less than 24 liters/day per person total water consumption, which comprises 15 liters/
day fresh water. 100% of the wastewater within our campuses is treated and reused for flushing, gardening and cooling tower makeup purposes.

Rainwater harvesting continues to be a focus area. 40 lakes across our campuses have a capacity
to store over 430 million liters of rainwater. 409 injection wells help in recharging over 20 million liters of rainwater per day, thereby improving the water table and enhancing water availability in the communities surrounding us.

Lake rejuvenation projects
Our commitment to water stewardship extends beyond operational efficiency to creating meaningful impact in the communities we operate. By collaborating with local stakeholders, we help restore water bodies and raise awareness about responsible water use. These efforts strengthen community resilience and foster a shared sense of responsibility for natural resources, ensuring that the benefits of water stewardship reach far beyond our

organizational boundaries. Our campuses are living laboratories for water stewardship.

Rejuvenation of lakes is vital for India's sustainable development. As water scarcity and urban pollution grow, restoring lakes ensures water security, recharges groundwater, and supports biodiversity. These ecosystems play a key role in climate resilience and provide livelihoods to local communities. Leadership at all levels, government, industry, and civil society,

must collaborate to protect these natural assets. Reviving lakes is an environmental imperative and a socio-economic necessity. It reflects responsible governance and long-term vision.

Infosys has taken up lake rejuvenation projects across multiple cities in India through local stakeholders and NGOs. The 11 lake rejuvenation projects currently taken up by Infosys is expected to create an additional capacity of 4.3 billion liters thereby enhancing the

water table, increasing water access, and improving health and wellness in the communities.

Waste	
Waste management is a complex global challenge, with practices and effectiveness varying widely across regions. Rising populations and shifting consumption habits are driving a surge in waste generation, while poor waste management continues to pollute land, water, and air, raising alarm over environmental degradation. Developing countries face particular hurdles,
including limited resources, rapid urbanization, and inadequate infrastructure to manage waste. The World Bank estimates global per capita waste generation at 0.74 kg per day, with projections indicating a rise to 3.4 billion tonnes annually by 2050, more than twice the growth rate of the global population. While traditional waste systems can manage annual costs, transitioning to a circular economy, through prevention, sustainable design, and full lifecycle management- offers greater long-term benefits. For Infosys, waste is a priority material topic with clear relevance
to our stakeholders. Our strategy is framed around circularity. Using a data-driven approach, we aim to continuously improve our waste strategy and enhance alignment with our broader environmental, social, and governance commitments.



Our approach
Our waste management strategy is firmly rooted in the principles of circularity, aiming not only to minimize environmental impact but also to reimagine waste as a valuable resource. This vision is supported by a robust combination of technology, behavioral change, and strong governance, with the ultimate
goal of achieving zero waste to landfill while advancing global sustainability objectives. Our

waste-related disclosures are aligned with globally recognized frameworks to ensure transparency and accountability. Our reporting is guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 306: Waste 2020 standard, as well as India's Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) requirements.
We tackle the waste challenge through a clear, structured strategy that spans the entire lifecycle of our operations. Our 5R hierarchy-Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Refurbish/Repurpose, and Recycle.

Towards zero waste to landfill
Through targeted recycling, reuse, and co-processing initiatives, we continue to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills. Our waste diversion strategies not only help us achieve environmental goals but also contribute to resource conservation.

Treatment
We have created capacity to treat 100% of the organic waste within our campuses (food waste and garden waste), through biogas plants and organic waste converters. The resulting biogas is used in

Segregation
Effective segregation of waste is achieved using wet and dry bins, and further segregation into different waste streams such as paper, plastic, metal, wood, etc. Storage of waste in scientifically designed
scrap yards with segregated waste stream enables effective disposal through authorized recyclers for each stream of waste.

TRUE zero certification
We have achieved TRUE zero certification for waste from Green Business Certification Institute (GBCI)

5R hierarchy-Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Refurbish/Repurpose, and Recycle

food court kitchens and the compost is used in the

process of getting TRUE zero certification.

Waste is an important dimension of the HSEMS policy, aligned with ISO 14001:2015 standards across all India locations in line with our HSE Strategy.


		



Governance framework
Our governance framework includes:

Policy & Protocols
Standard operating procedures for each waste category, updated annually or as necessary, to reflect changes in laws and best practices.

Audits & Legal Review
Regular internal and third-party audits verify compliance; any non-conformances trigger corrective action plans.

Vendor Evaluation Framework
We assess and approve waste-management vendors based on regulatory adherence, capacity for resource recovery, and sustainability performance.
E-waste management
As a technology-driven organization, the generation of e-waste is an inherent aspect of our operations. Our e-waste stream comprises a wide range of items, including IT hardware, mobile devices, printers, cartridges, electrical appliances such as refrigerators, microwaves, air conditioners, lithium-ion batteries, and various electronic accessories.

We have adopted a forward-looking e-waste management strategy that prioritizes refurbishment over disposal wherever possible. This refurbishment-first model not only extends the lifestyle of electronic assets but also aligns closely with circular economy objectives. For equipment that cannot be refurbished, we work exclusively with authorized recyclers who are rigorously assessed for compliance with legal standards
and the degree of circularity embedded in their recycling processes.

Employee and community engagement
We actively engage our employees and the surrounding communities to reinforce and extend our zero-waste goals. Building upon our strong stakeholder collaborations, we aim to create a culture of waste-consciousness both within and beyond the organization. Our approach combines education, hands-on activities, and community engagement programs to drive behavioral change and deepen understanding of waste circularity.

We run regular awareness campaigns-including mailers, workshops, and digital challenges- designed to inform employees about best practices in waste segregation and reduction.
These campaigns have featured initiatives like "Beat Plastic Pollution", where teams compete to minimize single-use plastics, and internal "waste plogging" events combining litter collection with jogging. Such activities not only reduce waste
on campus but also inspire participants to adopt sustainable habits beyond the workplace.

To extend our impact into the community, we partner with local schools and NGOs for student

outreach programs. Volunteers distribute compost and biogas slurry generated onsite to home gardeners, demonstrating the practical benefits
of organic-waste recovery. Sustainable-product giveaways-such as reusable bags and bottles- reinforce the message of waste prevention, while community clean-up drives help improve the areas surrounding our campuses. By empowering employees as ambassadors and collaborating with community stakeholders, we create a virtuous cycle of awareness and action. This people-
centric engagement complements our technical and operational initiatives, ensuring that waste management becomes everyone's responsibility and drives us closer to our zero-waste ambition.

Team members from our Mysuru campus landscaping unit participated in a plastic waste collection drive organized by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) at Chamundi Hills. The effort covered the temple surroundings and the entire 1,000-step path leading to the foothills, demonstrating our deep-rooted commitment to environmental stewardship both on and
off campus.

Innovations in waste management
Our focused efforts on reducing diversion from landfills resulted in piloting conversion of garden waste into biomass briquettes in our Hyderabad location. This project resulted in manufacturing biomass briquettes by the service provider which is then utilized as alternative fuel in boilers, in cement industry etc. We also piloted
an initiative where organic waste is transformed to compost with an innovative methodology using Black Soldier Flies at our Mangalore campus. This resulted in fast decomposition and more nutrient rich compost
compared to vermicompost which is used as manure in our campus landscape.

We also carried out creative sustainability initiatives by repurposing materials such as unused cable drums,
tyres, wood logs, plastic cans and bottles into aesthetic items like chairs, pots, and decorative pieces which are displayed on our campuses

Environmental compliance
Going beyond legal and regulatory obligations, Infosys has always been at the forefront of ensuring compliance through responsible business practices. As a global company, we abide by all international and national laws and uphold the standards of transparency and accountability.

We have a strong environmental management system aligned with ISO 14001:2015 standards across all India locations in line with our HSE strategy, which covers a significant portion
of employees across the organization. The management system is implemented across locations globally based on applicable legal requirements and internal benchmarks and are a part of our internal audit coverage. We ensure

adherence to applicable legal requirements across our locations.

We conduct environmental impact assessments for most of our activities. Environmental impacts of new services, activities, and changes in process or legislation are also assessed. We conduct environmental impact assessment studies for
all new projects, wherever applicable, covering

impacts related to air, water, social aspects, and biodiversity, among others.

No cases of monetary or non-monetary sanctions for violations have been reported in fiscal 2025. A process for monitoring requirements in line with legal requirements is established and we ensure that all parameters are always maintained well within the defined norms.

Enabling digital talent at scale	
Infosys' vision to enable digital talent at scale is founded on the recognition that we are in the age of artificial intelligence, a transformative era where the convergence of data, automation, and cognitive technologies is redefining every aspect of life and work. Digital literacy is no longer a competitive advantage, it is a fundamental necessity. Infosys believes that the future belongs to those equipped to co-create with AI, adapt to evolving technologies, and innovate to solve real-world challenges. As AI becomes embedded in decision-making, it opens unprecedented
opportunities to reimagine learning-making it more personalized, accessible, and impactful. This is also a moment to invest in societal progress. Infosys sees digital skilling as more than a corporate responsibility, a means to amplify human potential extending to underserved populations, schoolchildren, and university students, creating pathways for millions to become future-ready. By democratizing access to emerging technologies, Infosys is cultivating a global talent pool ready to thrive in the AI-driven economy.



Fostering inclusive growth
Infosys' initiative to enable digital talent at scale is a material issue for its stakeholders, as it directly supports inclusive growth, talent readiness, and equitable access to opportunities-priorities identified through our engagement with various groups. Advancements in technologies such as
AI and smart automation can be leveraged to boost productivity and address broader societal


challenges. Clients, governments, communities, and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on how companies are bridging the digital divide, especially as demand for digital talent surges globally. This aligns with Principle 8 of the BRSR which emphasizes inclusive growth and equitable development.
Expanding digital skilling efforts is not only a matter of good governance but also critical to Infosys' social license to operate and long-term value creation.

Approach
Leveraging our robust digital platform infrastructure, Infosys plans to scale through a multi-pronged approach:
• Enhancing programs focused on women
and girls.
• Expanding internships, and integrating AI- powered platforms with job marketplace features.


Going forward, we plan to expand the strategy to deeper collaboration with national digital skilling initiatives and universities, embedding integrated curriculums to build industry-ready talent. A diverse distribution across geographies, partnerships
with clients, governments, academic bodies, and direct-to-learner engagement further underscore our commitment to democratizing digital skills and enabling opportunities for everyone.

Skilling the Infosys workforce
Staying relevant has never been more critical, as the demand for new skills is outpacing the rate at which they can be acquired. To keep up,
skilling programs must be built around continuous learning-with a strong focus on employee growth and adaptability. Our AI-powered learning


ecosystem is designed to meet this need by enabling ongoing upskilling at scale. A key feature is its ability to deliver hyper-personalized learning experiences. Through the Lex platform, employees can access tailored learning paths,
virtual assistants, and gamified modules that make learning both engaging and accessible.

Foundation education program
The Foundation Program training for freshers focuses on grooming the young graduates into talented IT professionals. This training includes the basic IT skills training where the nitty gritty of programming is given more attention. Then the training focuses on making them well versed in a specific technology stream out of the 50+ available streams. The freshers are evaluated periodically through assessments.
They undergo a capstone project towards the end of the training which enables them to work with enterprise grade applications. The Foundation
Training Program, anchored across India, Mexico, the US, the UK, Canada, Germany, Australia, Singapore, and Japan, continues to enable newly onboarded entry-level hires to transform into corporate professionals. Comprising 50+ technology streams, the curriculum has kept pace with the dynamic business requirements and the preferred pedagogical approach of the current generation of talent. The curriculum continues to be current as courses on generative AI and prompt engineering have been introduced into the foundation program to equip
the freshers on the latest technologies. Fresh recruits undergo rigorous foundation training program in Infosys Global Education center at Mysuru which is largest corporate training facility in the world. Since its inception in 2005, 238000+ graduates with as many as 13,500 learners in one single batch have been trained by a pool of 850+ trainers.

Investments made on training freshers through the Foundation program are recovered within a month of their deployment to client engagements.

Continuous learning
Ensuring that Infosys' workforce remains agile, innovative, and aligned with the demands of emerging technologies is an imperative. The Lex



platform enables anytime, anywhere learning, used by employees to stay abreast with the latest technological trends.

Additional programs
Infosys continues to invest in additional programs that nurture future-ready talent and foster collaboration with emerging technologies.
The Company has deepened its academic partnerships, hosting various workshops with hyperscale partners like AWS, Azure, and GCP, offering employees hands-on exposure to cloud computing and GenAI technologies.

We also have programs supporting mid-level employees to advance their careers include Milestone programs and the Bridge program - an intervention that helps employees transition into new career streams.

Employees who are unable to clear the Foundation Education Program inspite of additional support and coaching are enabled to improve their
skills through external training, leveraging our partnerships with learning institutions.

Skilling the community
Infosys is committed to democratizing digital education through its Springboard initiative, which offers free access to quality online learning for students, educators, and underserved communities across India. With features like Lab on Wheels and the Springboard Makers Lab,
Infosys brings hands-on learning experiences to remote areas, breaking barriers of geography and connectivity. These community-focused programs are not only promoting digital inclusion but are also nurturing a broader, future-ready talent pool for the digital economy..



Infosys Springboard
In keeping with Vision 2030, we believe that access to digital education should be a right, not a privilege. That belief led to the creation of Infosys Springboard under our Tech for Good charter, a platform dedicated to bridging the digital divide and ensuring that no one is left behind in an increasingly connected world. Today, Springboard has grown into a catalyst for digital inclusion and
sustainable development. Millions of learners across India, whether in bustling cities or remote villages, are accessing free, self-paced online courses that cover emerging technologies and essential soft

skills. In partnership with many universities, and reaching more than 9 million registered users, Springboard is reshaping the way education is delivered, making it accessible, inclusive, and future-ready.

Springboard is more than a learning platform. It is a launchpad. Through career guidance, internships, and initiatives like "Her Journey to Success," we
are preparing learners not just for jobs, but for meaningful careers, particularly empowering women and girls to shape their futures with confidence. Innovation drives everything we do.

By integrating AI, VR, and AR technologies, Springboard delivers an engaging, personalized learning experience. Our collaborations with government agencies, universities, NGOs, and industry leaders amplify our reach, while our commitment to underserved and differently-abled communities ensures that no one is left behind.

We also know that barriers to education aren't only digital-they are physical. That's why we created the Springboard Lab on Wheels-a mobile classroom bringing world-class education to the remotest corners of India. Launched in Karnataka and piloted in Pune in February 2024, the Lab reaches learners who


might otherwise be disconnected from opportunity.

For areas with limited connectivity, our Springboard Raspberry Pi solution allows students to access content offline, uploading their progress once they reconnect. And at the Springboard Makers Lab in Pune's Symbiosis Lavale Campus, students now have access to hands-on, experiential learning that turns theory into practice. At Infosys, we are not
just preparing individuals for a digital future, we are helping build a more equitable, empowered world. Through Springboard, we are proving that when technology meets purpose, the possibilities are limitless.

Tech for good	
At Infosys, our belief in technology as a force for good is not aspirational-it is operationalized across every layer of our social impact agenda.

We have reimagined the role of digital platforms, AI, and skilling ecosystems to bridge systemic gaps in access, opportunity, and inclusion. Guided by this vision, we have empowered over 125 million lives through our Tech for Good initiatives-exceeding our target of impacting 80+ million lives by 2025 across education, healthcare, and e-governance. This extraordinary reach reflects not just scale, but sustained intent to democratize opportunity through responsible digital enablement.



Meaningful impact through technology
Tech for Good is a vital priority for Infosys stakeholders, reflecting our commitment to driving meaningful and inclusive impact through technology. We engage communities, an essential

stakeholder group, through local interactions, partnerships with NGOs, and digital channels. Our initiatives are designed to address structural gaps like digital literacy, preventive healthcare, and inclusive education, to empower individuals from

marginalized groups to participate in the digital economy. In doing so, Infosys reinforces its social license to operate, expand trust capital, and align with the long-term interests of stakeholders. This dual lens, impact and insight, defines how we lead in the era of sustainable technology.
Spotlight on MOSIP
MOSIP - Modular Open Source Identity Platform
In partnership with the Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP), Infosys has co- developed secure, inclusive digital identity solutions now used by governments in five countries. These open-source platforms have provided over 10 million individuals with access

to vital services like healthcare, education, and banking, especially in low- and middle-income nations. This contribution has unlocked access to critical public services, such as healthcare,
education, and financial services, and significantly advancing financial inclusion.

By supporting an open-source framework, Infosys is helping reduce the cost and complexity of implementing digital ID solutions, especially in low- and middle income nations.

MOSIP aligns with our belief that digital infrastructure should be interoperable, inclusive, and cost-effective, paving the way for national development. Infosys' technical expertise ensures these systems are robust and scalable, reinforcing our commitment to digital equity.

Spotlight on SightConnect
Launched in 2024, SightConnect continues to make eye care more accessible to all. It is a mobile app created through the Tech for Good program in collaboration with Infosys Foundation and the

LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI). It is designed to be simple, free, and available anytime, anywhere. It is an easy-to-use eye care tool, allowing individuals and community health workers to conduct basic eye tests, help diagnose eye conditions early,

and allow smooth referrals to specialists. These simple, but crucial functions are helping prevent avoidable vision loss in communities where access to healthcare initiatives is either lacking or unaffordable.








Multi-lingual capability
The app supports multi-lingual eye test questionnaires. Automated translations for both the app text and the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, powered by the Ai4bharat IndicTrans2 - Bhashini model ensures that language isn't a barrier to reach accessible care to India's diverse communities.

Smart, AI-powered features
With features like AI-based triage, facial recognition, and adaptive brightness, SightConnect is proving to be a practical, reliable solution for low-resource settings-taking quality eye care one step closer to everyone. Advanced facial contour recognition and
adaptive screen brightness ensure reliable results even in challenging environments. Through visual acuity testing and a questionnaire, SightConnect generates a
preliminary assessment of eye health, indicating whether an urgent or routine consultation is recommended. It
has been tested successfully in clinical trials at LVPEI. SightConnect's AI model that screens for early signs of cataracts and red eye is undergoing development.

Communication
Even with access to technology, patients may struggle to connect with health workers or may do so without the necessary information. Similarly, healthcare workers often face challenges in relaying accurate diagnoses to physicians. Bridging these gaps-by effectively connecting patients, healthcare workers, and doctors-can mean the difference between limited access to care and truly benefiting from it. Strengthening communication across this chain has reinforced the eye care ecosystem and extended essential services to individuals who often go without.

Digital cornea bank
Extending this mission further, Infosys is pioneering a digital cornea bank, a transformative step toward optimizing cornea preservation and distribution.
Powered by Agentic AI, this smart system is designed to significantly reduce cornea wastage



EYE CARE JOURNEY
In Telangana's Ranga Reddy district, a 9th-grade student underwent an eye screening using the SightConnect app at ZPHS Kandukur school. When the test indicated a vision issue, she informed her parents, who then accessed her test results through the app. With the in-app referral, they visited a nearby eye hospital where she was diagnosed and prescribed spectacles. This early
intervention helped her regain clear vision and continue her studies without hindrance.




and ensure more donated corneas reach patients in need. By digitizing and intelligently managing the corneal transplant process, Infosys is not just innovating in healthcare, but driving meaningful impact in the fight against corneal blindness.



EYE CARE EXPERIENCE
During a student screening at ZPHS Vamsoor in Khammam district, the class assistant decided to test his own vision using SightConnect.
The app flagged an urgent need for consultation. Following its guidance, he visited the L V Prasad Eye Institute where he received a prescription for spectacles and eye drops. The treatment greatly improved his vision, and he expressed heartfelt gratitude for
the technology that helped restore his sight.






HEADMASTER INITIATIVE FOR STUDENTS
After screenings revealed vision issues among students at ZPHS Kandukur, the Headmaster took proactive steps to ensure their
well-being. Using the SightConnect app, he identified students needing immediate attention and personally accompanied them to
a local eye camp. Thanks to his initiative and the app's guidance, eight students received spectacles, improving their ability to engage fully in classroom learning.

Nurturing Workplace Inclusivity	
At Infosys, we envision a future where diversity, equity, and inclusion power innovation, growth, and shared success across the world. We are committed to building and sustaining a workplace where every individual is respected, empowered, and given equal opportunity to thrive. Rooted in our Code of Conduct and Ethics, and guided by the principle of 'Respecting Each Other,' our vision for inclusivity is not just a value we uphold, it is a catalyst for taking everyone forward together.




Inclusion and innovation
We believe inclusion is a strategic advantage to any organization. A diverse workforce brings richer perspectives, fuels creativity, strengthens problem- solving, and drives deeper connection. Diversity drives innovation and innovation drives Infosys.

Our commitment is to create a gender-diverse workforce at Infosys, with 45% women by 2030 In 2025, this stands at 39%.

Our approach
At Infosys, our inclusion strategy is built on a simple yet powerful belief. The solutions we create must reflect the diversity of the customers we serve.
To truly understand and meet the needs of a global client base, we are committed to building an equally diverse and inclusive workforce. By cultivating an environment where different perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences are valued, we enhance our ability to innovate, solve

complex challenges, and deliver transformative outcomes for our clients around the world. In today's interconnected world, not embracing inclusivity
is a missed opportunity, becoming a significant business risk, impacting our ability to stay relevant, competitive, and resilient.

Our inclusion strategy is anchored in strong governance and data-driven leadership.

• Inclusion governance structure: Our goals are integrated into the corporate scorecard and cascaded in order to ensure accountability across levels. Our Inclusion Councils, established globally, across geographies, business units, and locations, create a powerful matrix of collaboration and ownership. These councils, composed of leaders from both business and enabling functions, are designed to address strategic priorities while being responsive to local diversity needs. Periodic reviews strengthen the impact and agility of our inclusion efforts.

• Data-driven inclusion leadership: The Infosys Inclusion Leadership Tool provides real-time,

24/7 access to data, empowering business and HR leaders to make informed, timely decisions regarding hiring, growth, and retention of diverse talent. This tool enhances visibility to accelerate action, and ensures that inclusion progress is measurable, transparent, and continuously evolving.
A culture of inclusion
At Infosys, inclusion is a living part of our culture, embedded in how we lead, learn, and grow together. Guided by the principle of 'Respecting Each Other', our goals are integrated into leadership KPIs, supported by multi-level Inclusion Councils, and reinforced through our learning platform LEX, which offers a multitude of resources on inclusion. Real-time sentiment tracking through Pulse ensures employee voices are heard and acted upon,
while communities like IWIN and campaigns like #ThriveAtInfosys fosters belonging and challenges biases. From inclusive infrastructure to flexible policies and cultural celebrations, every touchpoint at Infosys reflects our deep commitment to building a workplace where everyone feels valued, empowered, and included.

These initiatives help foster mutual respect, enhance collaboration, and ensure that our workplace thrives on the rich tapestry of perspectives brought by employees from varied backgrounds, experiences, and age groups.

Employee Resource Groups
Beyond leadership commitment and policy, there is a larger focus on where employees experience inclusion in their everyday workplace, interacting with colleagues and immediate teams. To strengthen these micro ecosystems, Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) act as huge enablers.

ERGs, including allies, provide a safe and supportive space within Infosys where employees can connect and foster a sense of belonging. The perspectives and ideas shared within these groups are taken seriously and thoughtfully considered.

Allocation, Assets, Confirmation, Master data etc., of self and the team. It avoids the need to go to multiple systems. Data can be queried in natural language making it easy for the manager.

• Policy Advisor: Revolutionizing the way, employees interact with HR for various services. For instance, the AI Assistant will


respond to employee queries by interpreting policy documents and personalize interactions based on an individual employee. The Navi orchestrator merges multiple domain advisors into a single interface, routing employee queries to the appropriate advisors. The advanced AI algorithm personalizes responses based on employee profiles, ensuring program effectiveness. This will in turn help reduce queries going to our helpdesk and directly to HR as well.

• Moments That Matter (MTM): Every employee has significant moments that create substantial impact on their overall satisfaction and well-being, during their organizational experience. MTM has been ideated to become a celebration platform which will be integrated into all celebrations, small or big, throughout the employee life cycle. Smart alerts inform employees on upcoming moments that matter in their team and they can use AI to generate cards and messages to their colleagues and teams.


For managers and leaders, AI tools enable intuitive access to data, proactive nudges, and insights that support informed, empathetic decision-making. Our AI-driven pulse analysis also empowers continuous listening, helping us identify employee sentiment and act early to enhance well-being and engagement.

In learning and development, we are deploying generative AI to deliver personalized learning paths, simulate real-world scenarios, and assist in content creation. AI companions on our learning platform Lex, such as Zoiee and SynthAIz, provide intelligent tutoring, summarization, and contextual learning support. These innovations ensure every employee receives guidance aligned to their goals, skill levels, and preferred learning styles. From automated offboarding to retention analysis, AI also supports thoughtful transitions while maintaining a human touch. Our vision remains clear: to responsibly use AI not as a replacement, but as a powerful enabler enhancing personalization, improving operational agility, and reinforcing our commitment to a
people-first, future-ready workplace.

Key initiatives
InfyTribes
At Infosys, we believe in a balanced approach to life. We are not just about work; we are about play too. Across the globe, we have vibrant
communities known as InfyTribes, where Infoscions come together to pursue their passions. Whether it's sports, arts, dance, music, AI, movies, or photography, our InfyTribes provide a platform

Infosys Alumni Meets
For the first time, we have organized events to connect and meet with our Infy alumni at our Development Centers (DCs). These alumni meets have seen a remarkable turnout, with nearly 8,000 alumni participating in around 10 events across various DCs.

Petit Infoscion
A special celebration dedicated to the children of Infoscions serving as a dynamic showcase for a variety of talents, deeply embedding the culture and essence of being an Infoscion. Each year it unfolds around a unique theme, ensuring our Petit Infoscions enjoy a memorable day filled with fun games, activities, delicious treats, rewards,

recognition and more. This year, we achieved a record-breaking footfall of over 100,000 across 20 DCs, saw a 33% increase in Petits to over 31,000, and set a World Record in the Wonder Book of Records.

InfyCares
This initiative was strategized to bring employee volunteerism to the forefront, and it has received a resounding response from teams across our
Development Centers (DCs). InfyCares has achieved over 1,30,000 volunteering hours in the past year, surpassing our initial commitment of 75,000 hours. With more than 34,000 volunteers across 21 DCs, our CSR programs are now an integral part of the InfyCares system, providing a consolidated view of our collective volunteering efforts.

Career growth and learning avenues
Learning and Career
LnC portal is a one-stop solution for employees' learning and career needs. Over the past year, it was redesigned to offer a more personalized experience, featuring the new Career Canvas. This consolidates multiple career avenues-IJPs, projects, and bridge programs-into one view, helping employees identify next-role possibilities, assess skill gaps, and receive personalized learning recommendations.

Capability Quotient (CQ)
Capability Quotient is a comprehensive framework that integrates technology skills, domain skills, foundational skills, and social skills to enable employees' holistic development. This enhanced skills framework fosters adaptability and ensures a sustainable competitiveness in a rapidly evolving landscape. Employees can increase their CQ by gaining knowledge, building experience and expertise, track their skill development journey and get feedback on these skills through learning
resources, endorsements, and manager evaluations. Employees with a higher CQ have greater access to new opportunities and interesting projects. CQ is planned to be rolled out, effective July 1, 2025.

The Platinum Club
The club is a niche experience created for our top performers. Members of this club are selected with great rigor and objectivity through a two-pronged approach of high performance and high capabilities (measured through consistent ratings and high DQ).

Performance management
Our Performance Management Process is a cornerstone of our talent strategy, built on the principles of rewarding performance, fostering a culture of continuous development, and skill- based growth. In alignment with our vision
of becoming a Skill-Driven Organization, the performance management process now integrates skill identification and skill proficiency assessment as core components of both goal setting and performance evaluation. These inputs form the basis for personalized skill journeys and individual development plans, ensuring that each employee is equipped to grow in line with both personal aspirations and organizational needs.
Goal setting within our process follows the SMART framework and is cascaded top-down to ensure alignment with organizational and team objectives. The process encourages a balance between individual and team goals, fostering collaboration and shared accountability.
Evaluation is supported by a multi-level approval workflow involving the appraiser (manager), reviewer (manager's manager), and approving authority (Department/Function Head). Additionally, we have introduced many features to aid
360-degree feedback.
Consultant evaluation - where specific goals can be assessed by cross-functional managers reflecting workforce mobility and dynamic role structure @ Infosys.
Delegate manager evaluation - which allows supervisors closely working with employees to provide first-level feedback.
The process is tailored to different organizational levels, with an annual cycle for Individual Contributors (ICs) and First-Level People Managers. To further support the IC stream, we have institutionalized a Quarterly Check-ins program that promotes ongoing dialogue around skill development, aspiration management, goal
progress, and employee engagement. A Bi-annual


cycle for Middle Managers enabling agile and responsive performance and talent management interventions. The annual cycle for Senior Leaders is designed to provide the necessary time horizon for these leaders to execute their strategic long-term vision and deliver sustained outcomes.
To ensure timely and unbiased evaluations, the system supports rolling goal assessments throughout the year, particularly aligned with
project closures. This helps mitigate recency bias and ensures that performance is evaluated in real- time. For Middle Managers and Senior Leaders, most goals are automated, with actuals auto fetched from internal systems. This automation enhances data integrity and minimizes human error.
The future is led from within
Infosys Leadership Institute
With AI playing a pivotal role in the next phase of transformation of organizations, the Infosys Leadership Institute (ILI) partnered with Kellogg to bring their highly acclaimed program on AI Applications of Growth to all its leaders. In FY25, over 1000 senior leaders of Infosys completed this certification program and most of them also
participated in a live discussion with the author of this course, Prof. Mohanbir Sawhney. This includes about 250 women leaders, with many of them also working on AI related projects and initiatives.
ILI strengthened the succession program by broadening its focus to key roles in business and enabling functions, and creating highly personalized development programs for the incumbents and successors in organizational
critical positions. The highly successful succession- enabling Constellation program aimed at high potential emerging leaders, was expanded and paired with a 10-month curated program with Oxford University. The Constellation leaders
also commenced work on cross-functional, strategic organizational projects, to bolster their
enterprise leadership, thus preparing them for


senior leadership positions. Broader leadership development and engagement continue with signature programs like the 10-month Enterprise Leadership program in partnership thus preparing them for senior leadership positions.Broader leadership development and engagement with multiple universities including Kellogg, Tuck, NUS, and the 6-month long Executive Presence and Presentation program in partnership with The Economist. More than 2000 one-on-one leadership advisory discussions were completed by ILI with leaders, focused on their leadership development plan. With more than 97% leaders completing
a significant development intervention, Infosys leaders invested 10,500+ leadership learning days equivalent on their development.

Leadership diversity continues to be important for Infosys and the acclaimed ILI #IamtheFuture program saw more than 200 women leaders completing a development program addressing critical and differentiating competencies needed for success and growth. About 100 women leaders completed a program with Stanford on Executive Communication, supported by one- on-one coaching from a global communications firm. Career conversations were completed for critical and high-potential women leaders across segments and delivery, and 200+ women leaders
completed a development coaching conversation with internal leadership advisors.

Our relentless focus on leadership development and engagement continues to set us up well for the future.
Employee satisfaction
Infosys has a robust mechanism to gauge employee sentiments and feedback through its Pulse survey. This tool collects ongoing and real- time feedback from employees anonymously on


key organization-wide themes that shape their experience, including work learning and careers through a micro survey every quarter.We also poll our employees on select tenure-based milestones and specific events. This cumulative understanding of employee perception, and feedback from actual events and milestones have strengthened our sensing architecture to obtain richer insights of employee experiences. To drive change across
the organization, all managers have access to a real-time customized dashboard with feedback from their respective teams, which enables them to engage with their teams better and address any concerns. This dashboard has multiple views and advanced analytics such as heatmaps, trendlines, and sentiment analytics to enable the managers to prioritize focus areas according to their teams.


This comprehensive ESAT result is based on feedback gathered across 22 distinct themes, with high scores in key areas such as Job Satisfaction (77%), Purpose (85%), Happiness- Sense of
Connectedness (87%) & Well-being Support (84%), Career & Learning (84%) and Innovation(80%).

The company's commitment to acting on feedback is evident in the 82% Employee Listening score.
This high score indicates that employees feel their feedback is not only valued but also leads to meaningful action, fostering a culture of trust and continuous improvement.

Attrition score remains low at 14% when compared to the pre-COVID period (18%).

Upholding values and rights
At Infosys, purposeful work begins with a foundation of integrity. We believe that for people to truly find meaning in what they do, they must first feel safe, respected, and valued. Upholding dignity, fairness, and trust in every interaction is not just a responsibility, it is essential to enabling purpose, building belonging and sustaining a culture where every individual can thrive.




up for a formal redressal process in line with the POSH Act and the Company's policy on anti-harassment as applicable. The reports on ASHI grievances can be shared to GRB@infosys.com and employees can also report complaints on the ASHI webapp or InfyMe mobile application.

Extending the initiative to contract staff

Resolution hubs
Infosys is committed to providing a safe and positive work environment. In keeping with this philosophy, the organization envisages an open-door policy
and encourages a culture of "speak up". Employees also have access to several forums where they can highlight matters or concerns faced at the workplace for effective remediation. This is achieved through
a well-established and robust grievance resolution mechanism comprising resolution hubs. Resolution hubs adhere to the principles of natural justice, confidentiality, sensitivity, non-retaliation and fairness, while addressing concerns. The concerns are handled objectively while ensuring timely action and closure. In matters that entail a detailed investigation, the process ensures fairness for all involved, with
an opportunity to be heard, present facts and any material evidence before a neutral panel.

HEAR
Infosys has a robust grievance redressal forum called HEAR (Hearing Employees And Resolving) fostering healthy employee relations and a positive work environment by giving our employees a neutral platform 'to be heard' and building the culture of

'speak up'. Employees can raise a complaint on the HEAR webapp or InfyMe mobile application or write to HEAR@infosys.com. HEAR adopts a decentralized model and addresses employee concerns in a structured manner with appellate forums for workplace grievances that have not been duly heard at the preliminary level by the Managers (or) line HR.

ASHI
The Company's assurance to its employees of providing a harassment-free workplace is reflected in our key initiative, ASHI (Anti-Sexual Harassment
Initiative). As per the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act in India, the Company has constituted Internal Committees (IC) in all the development centers with the ambit of the regulatory jurisdiction, for redressal of sexual harassment matters reported by women employees. We also have a strong governance mechanism in the form of GRB (Grievance Redressal Body) to define, interpret and implement Company's policy on prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace. GRB consists of external members, internal senior members, and the Investigative Council. Here, we follow a gender-neutral approach in redressal of all such complaints. Complaints are taken

Our commitment to a positive and safe working environment is not restricted only to our employees, but also third parties, who provide services in our campuses. We conduct refresher sessions for such third-party employees to reinforce the message.
These sessions are covered in nine vernacular languages in India currently. Emergency / safety cards with important contact numbers are also handed over to all Infosys employees and employees of such third parties. All our security personnel are trained in human rights policies and procedures.

Whistleblower Policy
The Company has formulated the Whistleblower Policy in line with the mandated regulatory requirements - Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), 2002 & Companies Act, 2013 - which mandates listed companies to establish a "vigil mechanism" for reporting genuine concerns.

The forum is predominantly for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding matters
of probable discrepancies in accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing, and also enables anonymous reporting by employees. While the Whistleblower Policy and the forum is administered and managed by the Office of Integrity and Compliance, complaints (anonymous or otherwise) pertaining to deviations in workplace policies / processes involving employees are reviewed in tandem by the Employee Relations Department.

Human Rights Assessment
Human Rights is an important area of focus in the annual integrated assessments conducted by the internal Corporate Certifications and Audits Team (CCAT). The assessment references GRI, SA8000, Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR). In FY 2025, over 80% of our global operations underwent the assessment. All locations have mitigation and remediation plans in place. While the assessment reveals there are no significant deviations and gaps in the implementation of human rights
practices, there are some improvement areas that have been identified and acted upon.

Return to office and hybrid work model
At Infosys, we follow a flexible hybrid work model. Our objective is to build and retain social capital among employees that will help enhance collaboration, innovation, productivity, and self-development in
a hybrid workplace. To offer further flexibility to employees, we have also opened offices closer to where our employees are based.

In the recent past, we commenced operations at our new centers in Indore, Nagpur, Hubballi, Vizag, Coimbatore, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Noida, in India.

ESG Governance
In October 2020, we launched our ESG Vision 2030. Our focus has been steadfast on leveraging technology to battle climate change, conserve water and manage waste. On the social front,
our emphasis has been on the development of people, especially around digital skilling, improving diversity and inclusion, facilitating employee wellness and experience, delivering technology for social good and energizing the communities we live and work in.

Our Enterprise Risk Management framework encompasses all the Company's risks - strategy and strategy execution; operational; and legal and compliance risks. Any of these categories can have internal or external dimensions. The systematic and proactive identification of risks, and mitigation thereof, enables our organization to boost performance with effective and timely decision- making. Strategic decisions are taken after careful consideration of primary risks, secondary risks, consequential risks and residual risks.

Building sustainable and responsible supply chains

Our upstream value chain consists of more than 9,000 suppliers across three categories - suppliers of people, suppliers of products and suppliers of services. Supplier relationships include longterm, short-term, contractual, and project-based relationships. Our procurement from MSMEs amounted to 9.7% of our overall spend. The entities downstream from us are our clients. We serve a variety of clients across diverse industries ranging from aerospace, automobile, financial services, healthcare, life sciences, utilities and more. For more information, read Business Consulting Services and Technology Services offered at Infosys.

Infosys believes in and is committed to partnering with the highest quality suppliers to ensure that we deliver best-of-breed business and IT solutions to our clients. As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), Infosys leverages the UNGC principles covering human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption as foundational
principles for building and improving its sustainable supply chain practices. The Company's Responsible Supply Chain and Supplier Diversity Policy is an expression of our commitment to integrate these principles into our supply chain relationships and towards building long-term environmental, social, and economic opportunities for diverse businesses. This commitment is manifested in our internal activities and processes, as well as through the organizations we engage with externally. Integrity and ethics govern all our supplier partnerships, while also supporting and encouraging the aspirations of diverse businesses.
Infosys Supplier Code of Conduct
Infosys is proud of the way it conducts its business and has always been a Company with a strong

commitment to ethical business practices and sustainability. We encourage our suppliers to join in this commitment, based on a shared set of values and principles. We pursue mutually beneficial relationships with our suppliers and seek to work with businesses that are committed to act fairly and with integrity towards their stakeholders, observing the applicable rules of law. The Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) draws inspiration from the Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics and the principles of the UNGC. It provides a detailed account of material topics that we are focused on to nurture and sustain
responsible supply chains. As part of the onboarding process, all vendors must accept the Infosys SCoC. This is tracked diligently by the procurement team. Violations to the Supplier Code, can be reported through http://oic.infosys.com and the Infosys Helpline numbers, whistleblower@infosys.com
and vendorincident@infosys.com. There were no supplier complaints in fiscal 2025.
Screening before empanelment
All our new suppliers go through an online ESG assessment through a third party tool as part of the pre-contracting process. The assessment covers publicly available information on sanctions, corruption, financial crimes, and litigations as
part of the Governance dimension of ESG. Once this assessment is complete and there are no adverse findings, suppliers indicate through our ESG questionnaire whether they have ESG
practices in their organizations covering social and environmental dimensions. If they respond in the affirmative, we invite them to share their ESG related information on social and environmental practices. In FY 2025, we onboarded 2015 new suppliers.
38% of our new suppliers have responded to our ESG questionnaire on social and environmental

practices as part of the onboarding process. The rest 68% have been invited to log into our ESG learning portal (Wingspan) and avail of the learning resources we have provided. This strategy is in line with our intent to strengthen ESG awareness and practice among our suppliers. Additionally, if a new supplier is part of our Top 75% spend, they will
also undergo an assessment on ESG performance through a third party provider. We also support their 'improvement' journey through sharing best practices and helping them engage with specialists we have identified for this purpose. In line with our statutory reporting requirements in the BRSR, we conduct these assessments for the top 75% spend suppliers annually.
Local procurement
Our centralized procurements are in India, but we engage with local suppliers for local needs across geographies. We track and report diverse
spends and make this information available to our clients on request. The proportion of spending on local suppliers was about 25.6% in fiscal 2025. We did not have any significant actual and potential negative environmental and social impacts in the supply chain.
Supplier engagement
Sambandh is our biannual supplier meeting. Our theme at Sambandh was 'Sustainable procurement through engagement'. Over 700 suppliers engaged in Sambandh across locations in India through fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. The engagement included workshops and discussions on the principles contained in the Infosys SCoC and ESG-compliant procurement practices.





ESG assessments
As of fiscal 2025, we have covered 800+ supplier groups through ESG assessments. The assessments cover governance, ethics and compliance with law, fair business practices, labor practices and human rights, health and safety, and environment. The assessment is based on a protocol which leverages the Infosys SCoC, ISO 26000, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and other international frameworks. The Infosys SCoC leverages the UNGC principles including protecting and upholding internationally proclaimed human rights, treating all persons with respect and dignity while safeguarding their rights, the elimination of forced and compulsory labor, the abolition of child labor in the supply chain and strong corporate governance practices including anti-corruption and anti-bribery and promoting fair business practices across the supply chain. During the assessment no actual and potential negative environmental and social impact was identified in the supply chain.

Deepening our responsible supply chain commitment
In fiscal 2025, we onboarded a third-party managed services provider to help assess our suppliers and guide their efforts in incorporating responsible business practices in their organizations. This program includes supplier assessments on a globally consistent framework along with industry benchmarks, supplier self- assessments through a questionnaire-led approach and capacity-building programs. This effort enables us to baseline supplier performance on ESG, encourage sharing of best practices and engage actively on improvement opportunities.
ESG learning channel for suppliers
We launched a dedicated learning channel for our suppliers on Infosys Wingspan. The portal contains ESG learning and best practices and provides learners an opportunity to discuss, ideate, and engage on ESG topics.

Decarbonizing the supply chain
Infosys has been a leader in climate action for many years due to its bold action in mitigating climate change impacts. Our ambitious ESG Vision 2030 and our goal to become climate positive in 2030 are important actions in this endeavor. We have been disclosing environmental information



ESG learning channel for Suppliers


through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) since 2006 and remain on CDP's leadership quadrant for the ninth year in a row. Our Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) endeavors to reduce our environmental impact, mitigate risk and, promote environmental stewardship in our operations, including our supply chains. To meet these ambitious goals, Infosys expects its supply chain
partners to align with the Company's environmental vision and ambitions. To support our suppliers' efforts for early adoption, we organized in-person four training sessions for suppliers representing
a large part of our capex in fiscal 2025 on climate change and the knowledge required to facilitate accurate climate change disclosures including best practices monitoring, maintaining, and improving data capture methodologies, emissions monitoring as well as calculation techniques applicable to the organization. The workshops leveraged Infosys' benchmark practices in environmental sustainability


while offering learners an opportunity to experience our campuses, referred to as 'living labs' for clean technologies.

Integrity and Compliance
The Ethics and Compliance Program at Infosys has two key objectives - to uphold and ensure the values of integrity and transparency and to assure enterprise-wide regulatory compliance. Integrity is key to nurturing a responsible business. Beyond regulation and stakeholder attention, there is
a growing recognition that good behavior is good for business. Our values are the principles we use to run the Company daily and are the source of our Code of Conduct and Ethics. Our values are the foundation of everything we do and are encapsulated in the acronym C-LIFE (Client value, Leadership by example, Integrity and transparency, Fairness and Excellence).




to build enduring relationships with our clients, employees, and partners. It has become a platform to create awareness and have an engaging dialogue with all stakeholders, and influence behavior and showcase the Infosys culture.

Regulatory compliance practice

Code of Conduct and Ethics
We firmly believe that following the highest standards of business conduct and ethics helps us run our business responsibly. Our Code of Conduct and Ethics ("the Code") helps us maintain the highest ethical standards in everything we do. It complies with the legal requirements of applicable laws and regulations, including antibribery and anti-corruption and ethical handling of conflicts
of interest. It also highlights expectations from our employees. The Code is signed off by the Board and the Office of Integrity and Compliance is the custodian of the Code. Our business partners
acknowledge and comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct.
Reinforcing a culture of compliance
Digital version of the Code
We also have a digital version of the Code. It offers a user-friendly and easy-to-navigate audio-visual
experiences that also allows access to specific topics in an interactive manner. The Code can be accessed on mobile devices as well. The digital version of the Code aims to help every employee understand the behavior we expect and the principles and values


we uphold. We aim to continue to build a culture of compliance, where everyone feels they can do the right thing and prioritize legal and ethical choices.

Training on the Code
Our employees and the Board members are trained on the Code. We have a Smart Awareness Quiz (SAQ), which includes training modules that employees are mandatorily required to undertake every year to renew their commitment to the Code. Our vendor partners were also trained on the
Supplier Code of Conduct through various channels including live sessions during the vendor partner meet called Sambandh. We also have a detailed communication plan to use multiple channels of communication like emails, video messages, blogs, gamified assessments, and storyboards to spread awareness about various policies.

#SwipeRightforIntegrity #SwipeRightforIntegrity is an annual legal and compliance event organized by Infosys. The event brings together our leaders to reinforce our values of integrity, transparency, and good governance

Officer (LCO) network has also been created across the Infosys Group in collaboration with the Office of Integrity and Compliance. The LCO network plays a crucial role in promoting an organizational culture that encourages ethical conduct and a commitment to compliance with the law, regulations, and policies and helps in maximizing the impact of ethics-related compliance training.
Statutory and regulatory compliance
Statutory Compliance Practice
Infosys has implemented a statutory compliance program covering a wide swathe of business enabling areas, covering units (inclusive of branches, subsidiaries, legal entities, etc.) across the global locations. This program has ensured that entities
set up, irrespective of the location, follow the law of the land not just during the initial startup phase but on a continuous basis. Compliance obligations on topics around Cybersecurity, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption, Anti-Trust, etc. are not just given due importance but are tracked, implemented, and monitored on a regular basis. The program is
monitored on a regular basis keeping pace with the growth of the organization globally.

In addition to the statutory one, Infosys set up a regulatory compliance program to centralize, track and monitor the implementation of compliances stemming from client engagements. Industry vertical compliances across 19 verticals have been scoped, implemented, monitored for effectiveness topped up with an overview of new compliances and/or changes to the existing ones on the horizon. The program enabled Infosys to comply with all the applicable laws and regulations, ensuring adequate governance across the industry spectrum.

Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI)

As a global technology leader, Infosys recognizes the transformative potential of AI. Our responsible AI framework is grounded in ethical principles: fairness, transparency, privacy, and accountability. We are dedicated to developing safe, unbiased, and human- aligned AI systems, governed by strong oversight mechanisms. Through ongoing stakeholder engagement and collaboration with global standards bodies, we aim to foster innovation that upholds public trust and protects societal well-being.

Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) practices and policy
Our ABAC practices and policy is reviewed by the Management at regular intervals. With an evolving landscape, Infosys is committed to a responsible ABAC risk management framework to demonstrate a comprehensive risk management program
to reduce the risks by regularly assessing risk in alignment with its growth strategies, and to drive an ethical and risk intelligent culture, to increase the certainty of business outcomes. Risk assessment for bribery and corruption is done periodically
and the criteria used include business units / internal departments, location, and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of countries, among others.

Anti-competitive practices policy
The Anti-Trust Policy states the objective, scope, applicability, and regulatory consequences.
This policy encompasses the three aspects of antitrust law bordering on: (i) abuse of dominance;
(ii) anti- trust; (iii) merger control. The policy is reviewed periodically by the Management for its appropriateness and applicability. In addition to the policy being setup, training is provided at regular intervals to colleagues and / or teams which form part of the high-risk group for better awareness.

Export control policy
The export control policy describes Infosys' export control program and is reviewed periodically by the Management. The export control program protects the Company and its employees from potential
risk of violation of sanctions prescribed under export control regulations and facilitates business expansion in accordance with these regulations. All our customers and vendors are screened against various sanctions to ensure that we are compliant.


As part of the program, training modules, and awareness campaigns are rolled out to relevant employees to ensure that they are aware and are compliant with export control laws. We have a
self-assessment and certification program in place for anti-bribery and anti-corruption, antitrust / anti- competition, and export control.

Whistleblower policy
The Infosys Whistleblower Policy is a comprehensive and well-designed mechanism that encourages employees, vendors, customers, and any other stakeholders to report any unethical conduct, violation of applicable laws or the Company's
Code of Conduct and Ethics occurring within the Company. With strict confidentiality measures and multiple reporting channels, the policy ensures that whistleblowers are protected from any retaliation. The Company reviews all complaints impartially and takes appropriate action, as applicable, while providing regular communication to ensure awareness
about the policy. The Infosys Whistleblower Policy is a testament to the Company's commitment
to transparency, accountability, and responsible corporate citizenship.
Use of technology for effective compliance monitoring of controls
We have leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technology to review and identify exceptions in compliance and Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption controls.

Compliance proof-testing
Infosys implemented a statutory compliance program covering 80 countries and 14 regulatory areas across major business enabling functions
in 2018. The program instituted a self-assessment


of the compliance status against a compliance framework with a maker checker process built into it alongside enabling the creation of a repository of compliance proofs against selfassessment. Through aggregating compliance proofs across countries and regulatory areas, Infosys designed an OCR- based technology to scan the proofs and validate if the proofs corroborate the compliance status. The
technology was further leveraged to combine it with a rule engine testing compliance control around timeliness and accuracy of the compliance proof uploaded.

Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) program
Infosys develops and manages multiple office facilities and collaborates with multiple vendors/ service providers during various phases of construction. Infosys engages with vendors for infrastructure development, facility maintenance and physical security. Sometimes, services to be obtained include permits, licenses, approvals, marketing activities / expenses, awareness campaigns and liaising with the authorities for filings and reporting requirements.

Infosys has implemented controls in procure-to- pay process to ensure appropriate proof of service by vendors is submitted, reviewed, and approved before payments are released. The systems also monitor the process of requisitioning, purchasing, receiving, paying, and accounting for goods
and services, from the point of order through to payment. Some of the controls built into the process are:
• Traceability of transactions at initial procurement stages through user declaration and OCR technology.


• Trail of documentation to substantiate various milestones and proofs of services availed.
• Built-in escalation matrix to ensure timely approval of red flags identified for appropriate resolution and action.
• Tracking of potential red flag indicators through use of tools.
• Periodic assessments of transactions on sample basis considering factors such as high-risk vendors/transactions.

In addition, digitized self-assessment and certification is also rolled out as part of monitoring and controls.

Grievance redressal
Our grievance redressal mechanisms are articulated in the Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics including a Whistleblower mechanism with non-retaliatory clauses for all stakeholders. Additionally, employees and contractual staff have access to robust resolution hubs. Suppliers are advised of grievance redressal mechanisms through the Supplier
Code of Conduct which they mandatorily sign. Employees, as important stakeholders, provide their feedback on a variety of topics on engagement through the periodic pulse survey. This offers
them an opportunity to share feedback on the design, review and improvements to grievance mechanisms. Infosys is committed to providing a safe and positive work environment. Employees also have access to forums where they can highlight matters or concerns faced at the workplace. This is achieved through grievance resolution mechanism comprising resolution hubs.

Engaging with stakeholders and earning trust through transparent communication
Effective stakeholder engagement allows us to proactively consider our stakeholders needs and
translate them into specific actions and informed decisions while building mutually beneficial relationships. Our stakeholder groups are investors / shareholders, clients, employees and sub- contractors, suppliers / partners, governments / regulators and the community at large.

Data Privacy	
Thought Leadership in Data Privacy
We understand that staying ahead in a dynamic privacy landscape requires leadership and advocacy beyond the organization. The
Infosys Data Privacy Office is deeply engaged with global industry bodies, regulatory groups, and standard-setting organizations. Through these partnerships, we help shape the development of data protection frameworks, policies, and international standards, particularly in emerging areas such as artificial intelligence. Senior leaders from the DPO frequently represent Infosys at international conferences and collaborate with governments and institutions to inform regulatory direction. These contributions underscore our role not just as a compliant entity, but as a driver of best practices in data privacy across industries and borders.



Evolving notion of privacy
At Infosys, we recognize that the rapidly evolving digital landscape has reshaped the very meaning of privacy. With the proliferation of technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and big data, we are seeing transformative benefits across society. However, these same technologies introduce greater risks related to data privacy
and security. Our business model involves the seamless global flow of data, which must comply with regulations that often have extraterritorial reach. That's why we emphasize the importance of consistent and effective data protection


practices across every country we operate in. Our independent Data Privacy Office (DPO) is central to this effort, ensuring that privacy is balanced with innovation. As AI continues to evolve, we are mindful that many existing privacy regulations already apply to AI systems that process personal data, and we closely align our practices with
key principles like transparency, fairness, non- discrimination, explainability, and human oversight.

To effectively manage these evolving risks and regulatory expectations, we have built a strong internal governance structure that supports our privacy objectives across the organization.
Governance and Organizational Structure
A well-defined governance model forms the backbone of our privacy framework. The Data Privacy Office at Infosys functions as both architect and checker of privacy controls, while business- enabling functions and delivery teams serve as makers. Periodic audits by internal and external entities reinforce accountability, and quarterly reviews by senior management provide strategic direction. Our multi-tiered governance is further

enhanced by three dedicated councils: the Privacy Sub-Council, comprising representatives from delivery and enabling functions; the Data Privacy Council, which includes business unit and function heads; and the Legal Compliance and Risk Council, featuring senior leadership such as the General Counsel, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Risk Officer.

This governance model supports our broader compliance strategy, which is focused on aligning operational practices with regulatory mandates and internal standards. Sustained Approach to Data Privacy Compliance.

Sustained Approach to Data Privacy Compliance
Infosys has long recognized the importance of a strategic and structured approach to privacy compliance. More than a decade ago, we established our Data Privacy function as an independent group reporting directly to top management. This function is built on the globally recognized Privacy Information
Management System (PIMS) framework and is responsible for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations across business processes,

applications, and client engagements. Our Data Privacy Policy-accessible to all employees via the intranet-reflects top management's commitment to privacy. This commitment extends beyond internal operations to include third-party service providers. In line with our values of transparency and accountability, we provide privacy notices at data collection points for both internal and external data subjects. The privacy statement for external stakeholders is also publicly available on our website and is routinely updated to reflect changes in data handling practices or applicable laws.
Read more.

As we continue to build on this foundation, embedding privacy into the design of our systems and services has become a key enabler of both compliance and innovation.

Customer data sharing
Customer data and cybersecurity is of the utmost importance to us. Infosys will provide information as sought by any Government or law enforcement agencies, in accordance with our legal obligations. We have not publicly reported such information for the fiscal year 2024-25 as there is no statutory requirement to do so.


		



Cross-Jurisdictional Compliance
At Infosys, we maintain a robust, enterprise-wide data privacy and compliance framework designed to meet the complex and evolving regulatory requirements across jurisdictions. A dedicated compliance team actively monitors legal and regulatory developments globally, leveraging inputs from multiple sources, including regulatory databases, industry bodies, law firm alerts, and consulting advisories. This monitoring enables near real-time identification of changes and facilitates timely compliance actions.

To operationalize compliance tracking, Infosys employs specialized tools while drawing on memberships with professional organizations including the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) and the Association of Corporate Counsel (ACC). A centralized compliance repository maps regulatory requirements to business-enabling functions, ensuring consistent implementation across the enterprise.

We conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) prior to initiating new data processing activities or deploying technologies involving personal data. This ensures that privacy-by-design principles are embedded from the outset. Our incident response protocols include predefined procedures for notification, assessment, mitigation, and documentation, supporting

adherence to cross-border data breach notification obligations.

In jurisdictions with data transfer restrictions, Infosys adopts appropriate legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and Joint Controller Agreements to legitimize international data transfers. Wherever possible, we aim to minimize or avoid such transfers in alignment with local regulatory expectations.

Demonstrating our commitment to global data privacy standards, Infosys became the first India-headquartered Company to receive
Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) approval from EU data protection authorities-an internationally recognized framework for safeguarding personal data transferred outside the EU.

As we continue to build on this foundation, embedding privacy into the design of our systems and services has become a key enabler of both compliance and innovation.

Privacy by Design Enablement
We believe that privacy should be integrated at the design stage of any process or application that handles personal data. To embed this principle into our organizational DNA, we launched the EPIC initiative-Embedding Privacy by Design into Infosys Culture. Rolled out by the Data Privacy Office in collaboration with quality and delivery teams, EPIC is a company-wide strategic program.
It incorporates privacy considerations into the architecture, development, and deployment phases of the software lifecycle. Through this initiative, our development teams are trained to apply the seven foundational principles of Privacy by Design using privacy design strategies, patterns, and privacy- enhancing technologies (PETs). This not only supports regulatory compliance but also fosters a privacy-first mindset among our engineers.

Our ability to design and deliver privacy-conscious solutions is further bolstered by adherence to global benchmarks and certifications.



Privacy Performance Metrics
We are continuously strengthening our data privacy measurement framework under the oversight of our Data Protection Office (DPO). Various metrics are regularly analyzed, reviewed for trends, and presented to senior leadership during the cross- functional Quarterly Data Privacy Council Meetings. Insights from these reviews guide continuous improvement initiatives across the organization.


		



Global Standards and Certifications
Infosys has adopted globally recognized protocols to fortify our data privacy practices. We are among the first few organizations worldwide to earn ISO 27701 certification for our privacy information management system. Our efforts to expand this certification across our global delivery centers are ongoing. Additionally, we recently became the first India-headquartered Company to achieve Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) certification from EU data protection authorities. This milestone underscores our commitment to responsible international data transfers and further aligns us with the highest global standards for data privacy compliance.

Press Release on BCR Certification

While governance, design, and certification strengthen our preventive posture, robust response mechanisms are essential for resilience and trust.



Contributions to Global Privacy Standards
Infosys plays a proactive role in shaping global data privacy standards through active contributions to international standard-setting bodies. Our Head Privacy and Data Protection is a recognized expert in committees such as ISO SC27, ISO SC42, and the IEEE Standards Association. Notable standards co- authored or edited by Infosys include:

• ISO 27701 - Privacy Information Management Standard (Published)
• ISO 29184 - Online Privacy Notices and Consents (Published)
• ISO 27565 - Guidelines on Privacy Preservation using Zero Knowledge Proofs (In Progress)
• ISO 27561 - Privacy Operationalization Model and Methods (Published)
• ISO 27568 - Security and Privacy of Digital Twins (In Progress)
• ISO 10267 - Data Usage - Personal Information Factor

• IEEE P7012 - Machine-Readable Personal Privacy Terms
• IEEE P7030 - Global XR Ethics
• IS 17428 - India's Data Privacy Standard (Convenor; Published)

Data Subject Rights and Breach Management
Safeguarding the rights of individuals is fundamental to our privacy strategy. As data subject rights become a core component of regulatory frameworks around the world, we have implemented processes that allow us to address such requests in a timely and compliant manner-even in complex enterprise settings where data resides in multiple formats and
geographies. Managing these rights involves careful navigation of overlapping legal exceptions and system limitations, but we remain committed to honoring them. In parallel, we have established a comprehensive incident and breach management framework. At Infosys, we have robust procedures in place to detect, assess, contain, and resolve
data privacy incidents. Our team of dedicated privacy professionals works closely with business units, legal, information security, communications, and external providers to ensure rapid and effective response. For high-impact cases, or those that require it by law, we notify the affected individuals and supervisory authorities, offering full disclosure and support. Such incidents are also reported to our senior leadership via the
Incident Disclosure Committee. Our zero-tolerance approach is reinforced through strict consequence management and preventive action mechanisms, with key lessons integrated into organization-wide awareness campaigns.

To ensure these efforts are sustainable, we have prioritized building a strong culture of privacy awareness throughout the organization.


		



Building awareness and culture of privacy
We actively promote a culture of privacy awareness among our employees and stakeholders. Each year, we celebrate Data Privacy Day through interactive and engaging activities such as quizzes, crosswords, Pictionary games, and "chat with the DPO" sessions. Senior leaders also deliver messages that reinforce the importance of privacy across the organization. Monthly privacy tips-based on real-world scenarios and evolving threat landscapes-are shared
widely to deepen organizational understanding. Participation in our privacy awareness program is mandatory. Every Infosys employee and subcontractor is required to complete a role-
specific privacy awareness quiz annually, ensuring that knowledge remains both current and contextualized.

This internal commitment is mirrored by our external engagement efforts, through which we shape the broader privacy ecosystem.











Looking ahead: Future-ready data privacy
As digital ecosystems evolve, Infosys is proactively preparing for a new generation of privacy challenges driven by technologies such as Generative AI, quantum computing, and decentralized identity.
Our forward-looking strategy is anchored in innovation, resilience, and global accountability. As privacy risks increase in complexity, from AI-
generated content to biometric surveillance, digital identity, and smart environments, Infosys remains

resolute in treating privacy not just as a compliance necessity but as a core ethical and enterprise value.

Infosys has set a strategic goal to expand its
ISO 27701 certification across all relevant global operations in a phased manner in order to achieve enterprise-wide coverage, reinforcing our position as a global leader in privacy governance and ensuring that our privacy practices remain resilient and future-ready.

Infosys Cybersecurity program ensures that required controls and processes are implemented, monitored, measured, and improved continuously to mitigate cyber risks across domains.

Infosys' Cybersecurity framework is built basis leading global security standards and frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity framework and ISO 27001 which is structured around the below four key areas:





Infosys is committed to
• Protecting the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information assets from internal and external threats
• Ensuring and maintaining stakeholders trust and confidence about Cybersecurity

The executive Cybersecurity governing body is in place to direct and steer:
• Alignment of Cybersecurity Strategy and policy with business and IT strategy.
• Value delivery to stakeholders.
• Assurance that cyber risks are being adequately addressed.




Approach



The framework also entails a comprehensive Cybersecurity maturity model which helps to ascertain the Cybersecurity maturity as well as benchmark against industry peers on an
ongoing basis. This helps in continued oversight and commitment from the Board and Senior Management on an ongoing basis through



the Information Security Council (ISC) and the Cybersecurity sub-committee.

In keeping with the 'defense in depth' philosophy, we have deployed several layers of controls to ensure that we keep ours, as well as our clients' data, secure and thereby always uphold stakeholders' trust.


		



Cybersecurity Management and Reporting
The cybersecurity practices at Infosys have evolved to look beyond compliance. The comprehensive cybersecurity metrics program has been contributing to the continuous improvement of the existing security practices and integration of cybersecurity within the business processes.

Information management, being an essential part of good IT governance, is a cornerstone at Infosys and has helped provide the organization with a robust foundation. Care is taken to ensure that standardized policies or guidelines apply to and are practical for the organization's culture,
business, and operational practices. Cybersecurity requires participation from all spheres of the organization. Senior management, information security practitioners, IT professionals, and users have a pivotal role to play in securing the assets of an organization. The success of cybersecurity can only be achieved by full cooperation at all levels of an organization, both inside and outside and this is what defines the level of commitment here at Infosys.

As a final level of defense, we undergo many internal audits as well as external attestations and audits in a year at an organization level (e.g.
SSAE-18 SOC 1 & SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001). We also
undergo client account audits to assess our security posture and compliance against our obligations on an ongoing basis.

There was no material cybersecurity incident reported in fiscal 2025.

Our industry contributions and thought leadership
In this era of rapid technology disruptions and digital transformations, Infosys enables the businesses to embrace innovations and adapt to new technologies. We focus on strengthening cyber resiliency through platform led convergence and consolidation of security capabilities and deliver
AI-first service offerings.

We promote cybersecurity through various social media channels such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube; sharing our point of views, whitepapers, service offerings, articles written by our leaders, their interviews stating various perspectives, and podcasts through our corporate handles providing cybersecurity thought leadership. The topics include impact of evolving technologies such
as GenAI on cybersecurity, cloud security, data privacy and protection, and compliance, etc. In addition to this, we work with analysts such as PAC

Group and industry bodies such as Data Security Council of India (DSCI), Information Security Forum (ISF), etc. to create joint thought leadership that
is relevant to the industry practitioners. In our efforts to strengthen cyber awareness across social communities, we also participate in cybersecurity awareness initiatives led by non-profit organizations such as NASSCOM. Further, we publish a technology centric report that provides insights into emerging technology trends and how they can be applied
to businesses. It essentially acts as a guide for enterprises looking to navigate the evolving digital landscape and make informed technology decisions based on current trends. We also host various
global chapters of Infosys regularly that aim to be a catalyst for innovation and transformation in the cybersecurity domain. The distinguished members
of the council collaborate to discuss, strategize, and prepare roadmaps to address the current security challenges of member organizations and help decipher the evolving industry trends. We, therefore, through various channels, drive awareness of and appreciation for cybersecurity.

Vulnerability Management
The vulnerability management program at Infosys follows best-in-class industry practices coupled with top-notch processes that have been evolving over the years. Rich experience of deftly managing the end-to-end vulnerability life cycle of Infosys Network and the constant hunger to stay abreast of the latest tools, technologies and related market
intelligence have acted as a catalyst in fortifying the overall vulnerability management program.

A robust enterprise vulnerability management program builds the foundation for healthy security hygiene of an organization. The following practices have been put in place at Infosys for,

1. Real time asset discovery followed by instantaneous identification of vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and timely remediation
2. Automation of vulnerability management, configuration compliance, security assessments and review for assets, applications, network devices, data, and other entities in real time
3. Close coupling of detection and remediation processes; auto prioritization to reduce the turnaround time for closure of detected vulnerabilities
4. Continuous monitoring of all public facing Infosys sites and assets for immediate detection of vulnerabilities, ports, or services
5. Regular penetration testing assessments and production application testing for detection and remediation of vulnerabilities on a real time basis


		



The vulnerability remediation strategy of Infosys focuses on threat-based prioritization, vulnerability ageing analysis and continuous tracking for
timely closure. We have successfully eliminated the ticketing system for vulnerability tracking by establishing a continuous detection and
remediation cycle, where the IT teams are enabled and onboarded onto the vulnerability management platform. A Cybersecurity awareness culture is nurtured, and teams are encouraged to proactively remediate the vulnerabilities reported on their assets or applications.

Supply Chain Cyber Risk Management
A comprehensive supplier security risk management program at Infosys ensures effective management of potential security risks across the various stages of supplier engagement. The process comprises:
• Categorization of the suppliers based on the nature of the services provided and the sensitivity of the data involved.
• Defining standardized set of information security controls as applicable to each category of supplier
• Defining, maintaining, and amending relevant security clauses in the supplier contracts as applicable to each category of supplier
• Due diligence, security risk assessment for effective management of the information security risks associated with suppliers

Defining and monitoring of key security metrics for suppliers (e.g., background check, security
awareness training completion, timely interventions with regard to information security incidents
etc.) threat intel tracking and governance further strengthen the Infosys supplier security risk management program.

Cybersecurity Competency Development
With the increasing demand for cybersecurity jobs and a skilled workforce, Infosys has taken several measures to counter the cybersecurity talent shortage as well as in skilling, retaining, and diversifying its security workforce in areas such as
application security / secure development lifecycle.

Cybersecurity team members undergo technical as well as behavioral training on an ongoing basis.
Infosys leverages internal training programs, as well as external bodies / agencies with cybersecurity subject matter expertise, with a strong focus on learning through the classroom as well as on-the- job training.
