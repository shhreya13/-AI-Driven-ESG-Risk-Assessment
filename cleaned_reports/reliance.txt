Reliance operates with a mission to be the most innovative, and value- generating organisation for all stakeholders. This purpose- driven ecosystem is supported by a set of core values and strategic growth engines driven by dedication to innovate
and leverage to cutting-edge technologies.







It is important that Reliance manages its raw material supply chain, assets and fuel, power & utility consumption in the most efficient manner to generate superior returns while reducing carbon footprint through its energy-efficient operations.


The availability of raw materials is crucial for the smooth running of Reliance's business operations. Judicious use
of raw materials can have a long-standing impact on the Company and local
economy. The availability of raw materials can also directly impact Reliance's ability to meet market demand for its products.

By embracing disruptive possibilities and fostering a culture of innovation, Reliance can drive growth, stay ahead of competition and unlock new opportunities.













Dedicated teams at both site and group levels are focused on energy management and closely monitor energy consumption patterns across all manufacturing sites.
Regular audits are conducted to improve energy performance and benchmark against other international refineries and petrochemical sites.


Reliance has taken several measures to ensure the security of raw materials. Firstly, it has long-term contracts for crude & feedstock, from multiple suppliers across different geographies, ensuring no loss in throughput. Additionally, efforts have been made to maximise sourcing of arbitrage crude and SRFO, expanding the options for raw material procurement. Further, the Company has vessels on long-term charter supporting logistics security. The Company also has
long term contracts for timely imports of EDC Investments in new materials while
maximising product netbacks. Implementation of the Vinyls project by 2026 will make the organisation self-reliant on EDC.

The approach adopted by Reliance can result in continued development of new products and services, entry into
new markets and improved competitive positioning. By leveraging technology and strong project management capabilities, Reliance can maintain operational efficiencies and cost leadership. This can improve profitability and provide a competitive edge in the market. Adoption of deep tech will provide disruptive opportunities across businesses.


Inefficient energy use can lead to higher input costs, reduced margins, and potential penalties or increased compliance costs in a net-zero transition landscape.





Lack of raw material security may cause the Company to move its operations to different locations, leaving behind overused/exploited spaces for local communities.

Strong supply chain standards, monitoring mechanisms and ongoing engagement models with suppliers to address labour concerns are critical for Reliance to protect shareholder value over the long term.
Sustainable supply chains are essential to further the
Company's progress on its Net
Carbon Zero goal.










Competition from other oil marketing companies poses
a risk of customer retention as the country has a surplus of petroleum products. Similarly, the country is surplus in
major petrochemicals such as Polyethylene and Polypropylene. Further, there are large imports of petrochemicals from the Middle East and FTA countries such as ASEAN & South Korea. It is important for Reliance to position itself as a customer- focused organisation by offering them a wide range of choices, outstanding value proposition and unmatched experience.

The Company has a structured approach to enhancing supplier performance and deepening sustainability practices. It has a well-defined Code of Conduct that mandates respect for human rights across
the value chain. The Company's sustainable sourcing ethos focuses on the following parameters:
1. Green Packaging
2. Environment Protection
3. Supplier Collaboration
4. Minimising Emissions Using Scrubber Fitted Vessels / VLSFO, Complying with EEX I & CII
5. Make in India and Development of India's
Engineering Talent
6. Launch of Digital Platform Applications
7. Contract Worker Care
8. Community Support
9. Regeneration and Safe Disposal


Ensuring timely deliveries, quality assurance, efficient logistic solutions, pricing
options, etc. at dynamically competitive prices ensures customer satisfaction in Reliance's business. The Company offers a wide product portfolio to meet evolving customer demand. A diversified customer profile across various geographical regions provides alternative markets for the Company's products. All businesses of Reliance have taken cognisance of 'CUSTOMER SATISFACTION' as the
topmost value and priority.

Any failure on the part of suppliers to comply with dynamically changing regulations can disrupt the Company's operations and create negative sentiments among stakeholders, including customers, and impact business.













Any sub-optimal customer experience may result in customer dissatisfaction. Inability of the business to stay abreast of recent trends and behaviours could weaken its compelling value proposition and have material impact on brand, reputation and financial performance.

9 | Talent Management

The commitment to 'care' underlines every action undertaken by Reliance. Thus, it is essential for the Company to continue implementing
community-facing programmes that can benefit society and result in true economic growth.Through its CSR initiatives, Reliance has catalysed development in education, healthcare, sports, and environmental and social development in the underserved and marginalised sections of society. In addition, Reliance partners with various organisations and government bodies to undertake development projects for livelihood enhancement, infrastructure, water management and disaster management to create a positive and lasting impact on the communities it serves.Building empowered communities by fostering trust and shared prosperity ensures the social license to operate, enhancing brand reputation and customer loyalty.
Given the scale and breadth of Reliance's operations, retaining high-calibre talent is imperative and a source of competitive advantage for the business.Reliance has robust talent management systems to identify employees with high calibre and provide opportunities for career growth and development. This helps to retain top talent, create a culture of
continuous learning and build a more skilled and knowledgeable workforce that can drive business performance and innovation.
Reliance offers peer-benchmarked monetary and non-monetary benefits to enhance employee engagement and retain top talent.Ineffective implementation of talent management processes might have an impact on talent sustainability, impeding business performance and growth of the Company.10 | Labor Management and Human Rights7 | Business Ethics, Integrity and Transparency, Code of Conduct and Grievance Redressal Mechanisms
Managing business ethics and maintaining high levels of transparency is important for Reliance. Establishing an effective grievance redressal mechanism is essential for Reliance to track the issues raised by stakeholders and take timely action to resolve concerns raised.Reliance has a well-established Code of Conduct that is applicable to its employees and the value chain, supported by strong governance structures and business practices to prevent unethical conduct, corruption and wilful or unintentional participation in illegal or unethical payments. Reliance has an effective mechanism to address the grievances of all stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, customers and communities. This encourages stakeholders to raise their genuine concerns to the management without fear of reprisal.Inappropriate / insufficient action on violation of business ethics could lead to significant one-time costs (including loss of reputation) or higher ongoing compliance costs.Maintaining cordial labour
relations is crucial for Reliance to ensure the well-being and productivity of its workforce. A healthy labour relationship establishes a unified mission, which results in enhanced job
satisfaction, employee retention and organisational performance.Reliance follows the principles of the United
Nations Global Compact on human rights, labour practices, environmental protection and anti-corruption. The Company's operations adhere to local and national regulations and ensure adherence to the RIL Code of Conduct.Failure to maintain proper labour
relations can lead to loss of productivity, potential legal liabilities and implications to the organisation's reputation.11 | Data Privacy and Cyber Security Risk

RIL businesses constantly endeavour to provide enhanced customer experience through digitisation of processes.
However, this extends RIL's attack surface and makes it a prime target for threat actors, thereby making cybersecurity and privacy a significant concern.The Cyber Security strategy at RIL is 'Aligned to Business' and 'Marked to Threat'. RIL follows a defence-in-depth approach, whereby multiple security technology solutions and processes are deployed to improve resilience against diverse and
ever-evolving threats. Privacy by Design principles are followed across the personal data lifecycle, business processes and business applications at RIL. Further, RIL regularly benchmarks its cybersecurity and privacy practices against applicable laws, regulations, industry best practices and standards through internal and external attestations to ensure compliance and enhanced assurance.Cybersecurity incidents (e.g., loss of business data, disruption in business operations, etc.) and data privacy breaches can lead to substantial financial losses, erosion of investor
and customer confidence, reputational damage and legal as well as regulatory repercussions.8 | Diversity Equity and Inclusion

The Company has championed the cause of Diversity Equity and Inclusion (D&I) in the workplace alongside its goals of growth and expansion.
Thus, it is essential to promote a progressive and inclusive workplace that onboards people from diverse backgrounds and provides them meaningful growth opportunities.The Reliance Group's Diversity
Equity & Inclusion (DEI) Charter was launched affirming Reliance's unwavering commitment to the values of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. To stay competitive in today's fast-paced business environment, some key diversity and inclusion initiatives undertaken include:
- R-Shakti, second career programme for women returning after a career break
- Developmental journey for high-calibre women under R-Aadya
- Dedicated mentoring for women
- Inclusive leadership training
- 'Inspiring Leader Connects' Series to create a more enabling workplace
- Employee storytelling and celebrations of diversity days

The Company faces both physical and transitional risks associated with climate change. Physical risks include climate- related events that could disrupt operations, impact financial stability and hinder value creation. Transitional risks arise from shifts in the energy market as global economies move toward cleaner energy sources and sustainable practices.The Company has adopted a proactive strategy to reduce its environmental impact, focusing on lowering its carbon footprint.
This includes a focus on opportunities with strategic emphasis on developing renewable energy sources, creating eco- friendly materials and deploying innovative technologies. These efforts are designed to strengthen resilience against climate- related risks and support sustainable growth.The Company's initiatives to reduce emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources align with global environmental goals and contribute to long-term financial stability. Investments in renewable energy diversify the energy portfolio, while
advancements in electric mobility align with market trends and position the Company to capitalise on emerging revenue streams in electric vehicle infrastructure and battery technology. Additionally, the development of biofuels
and other low-carbon energy sources provides alternative revenue streams, reducing exposure to financial risks. By embracing sustainable practices, the Company is well-prepared to adapt to regulatory changes, market shifts and evolving customer preferences, ensuring a competitive edge in a rapidly changing landscape.
The Company relies on water to maintain smooth operations. As a responsible corporate entity, it is essential to map and manage water usage across operations to ensure socially equitable and environmentally sustainable consumption.The Company has adopted a comprehensive strategy to reduce freshwater withdrawal and consumption, aligning with its sustainability commitments. This includes maximising water recyclability and minimising external discharge through the deployment of advanced technologies and stringent governance measures. The Company monitors water usage, reviews performance and ensures compliance
with applicable regulations. Additionally, it is actively exploring innovative solutions to improve water efficiency and enhance waste management protocols.Water dependency poses a tangible risk to the Company's operations, potentially impacting resource availability and increasing costs in
the future. However, the Company's commitment to sustainable water management practices mitigates these
risks by reducing reliance on non-renewable resources and improving operational efficiency. Investments in advanced technologies and water recycling initiatives not
only lower long-term operational costs but also strengthen the Company's reputation as an environmentally responsible organisation. These efforts position the Company to navigate regulatory changes and resource scarcity effectively, ensuring financial stability and resilience.16 | Ecosystem and Biodiversity14 | Managing Environmental Impacts

Effective environmental stewardship is critical for the Company to proactively assess potential risks associated
with its operations, adhere to regulatory requirements, mitigate risks and uphold its reputation. As environmental regulations and stakeholder expectations continue to evolve, the Company must
remain vigilant in assessing and managing these risks.
The Company has implemented a robust framework to proactively reduce its environmental impact and minimise its environmental footprint. To strengthen its environmental stewardship, the Company is strategically investing in advanced emission reduction technologies and enhancing energy efficiency across its operations. The Company has comprehensive monitoring systems for rigorous oversight for managing of emissions including greenhouse gas (GHG). The Company has stringent operational protocols in place to prevent spills during the storage, handling and transportation of hydrocarbon materials.
Additionally, the Company prioritises continuous education for employees and contractors through regular training and refresher courses, ensuring they are
well-informed about evolving legislations, pollution prevention strategies and waste minimisation techniques. These proactive measures not only mitigate environmental risks but also align with global sustainability goals, reinforcing the Company's commitment to responsible operations.
The Company's proactive efforts to manage environmental impacts and reduce its environmental footprint are integral to its
long-term financial stability and operational resilience. By investing in emission reduction technologies and energy efficiency, the Company not only avoids potential financial impact and risks but
also positions itself as a leader in sustainability. This enhances its reputation among stakeholders, including investors, customers and regulators, and creates opportunities for cost savings through optimised resource use. Furthermore, aligning
with escalating environmental expectations helps the Company mitigate risks associated with regulatory changes and market shifts. These efforts ensure the Company remains competitive in a rapidly evolving landscape, while also contributing to a sustainable future. Overall, the financial implications of these initiatives are positive, as they support both operational efficiency and long- term value creation.It is imperative for the
Company to collaborate with stakeholders to address ecosystem and
biodiversity concerns related to land use, greenfield expansions, rehabilitation and redevelopment.The Company is committed to
preserving biodiversity and achieving a net positive impact on ecosystems.
It conducts detailed impact assessments for projects where biodiversity is a consideration and implements periodic monitoring to evaluate ecosystem quality. The Company collaborates with stakeholders and partners to identify and advance approaches that align with its environmental goals. Successful initiatives include the development of green belts and the restoration of natural habitats, demonstrating its dedication to environmental stewardship.The loss of ecosystems and
biodiversity could lead to financial risks, project delays and increased operational costs. However, the Company's proactive measures to ensure compliance with biodiversity preservation requirements
and its efforts to mitigate biodiversity risks help reduce these potential financial impacts. Initiatives such
as habitat restoration and greenbelt development not only enhance the Company's environmental credentials but also contribute to long-term sustainability. These efforts strengthen the Company's reputation, ensure regulatory compliance and support its commitment to environmental responsibility, ultimately
fostering financial resilience and stability.

The Company generates various forms of waste, including hazardous materials, from the processing and storage of petroleum products. Improper management of these waste streams could pose risks to human health, the environment and regulatory compliance. Maximising circularity and innovation across the value chain is essential to mitigate these risks and promote sustainability.The Company has implemented robust measures to reduce, recycle and manage hazardous waste streams
effectively. A structured process is in place for decommissioning facilities, reducing regulatory and litigation risks and lowering associated costs. Additionally, the Company undertakes various initiatives to promote sustainability, such as recycling PET bottles and used PPEs, and developing innovative solutions such as waste-to-road and waste- to-oil technologies.Inadequate waste management could lead to regulatory penalties, environmental damage and increased operational
costs. However, the Company's consistent efforts to reduce waste generation and promote circular economy practices mitigate these risks. By investing in innovative waste management solutions and recycling initiatives, the Company not only reduces its environmental footprint but also lowers long-term operational costs. These efforts enhance
the Company's reputation as a sustainable and responsible organisation, ensuring
compliance with regulations and fostering financial resilience. The focus on circularity also opens up opportunities for cost savings and revenue generation through resource efficiency and waste valorisation or upcycling.The Company's operations span
geographical areas, including onshore, offshore and airborne activities, making it vulnerable to unplanned events, natural calamities, which include industrial accidents, extreme weather events, earthquakes, floods, cyclones and other unforeseen events.The Company has implemented a
comprehensive disaster preparedness and management framework to mitigate risks and ensure operational resilience.
Manufacturing sites are designed with a loss prevention design philosophy to minimise risks. Additionally, each site has pre-incident plans for emergency response and control, ensuring that resources, protocols and personnel are well-prepared to handle emergencies. The Company conducts regular drills and simulations to test and refine emergency response plans. The Company has developed robust business continuity plans (BCPs) that are regularly rehearsed to ensure readiness.
The Global Corporate Security (GCS) team plays a pivotal role in disaster management by working closely with business units
to conduct regular and thorough risk assessments. GCS leverages the expertise of best-in-class security professionals with multi-domain knowledge to identify and address evolving risks.By proactively addressing
these risks, through upfront investment in resilient infrastructure, loss prevention design and emergency planning, the Company protects its workforce, safeguards its
assets and ensures business continuity. These measures are critical in mitigating potential financial losses from operational disruptions, asset damage or reputational harm. Additionally, the Company's commitment to disaster preparedness enhances its reputation as a responsible and resilient organisation,
which can positively influence stakeholder confidence and long-term financial stability.20 | Security and Asset Management

P1
Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with integrity, and in a manner that is Ethical, Transparent and Accountable

While business activities are essential to facilitate human well-being, they can impact the environment and society in various ways. Responsible business conduct can go a long way to limit and mitigate these impacts. Therefore, businesses must balance the needs of people and the planet with the goal of prosperity. They must operate transparently, comply with regulations and stay accountable to their stakeholders.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The resources and materials that are utilised in the manufacturing processes at RIL are utilised optimally with minimum generation of waste by deploying
the best of technologies to operate the units with maximum efficiently. Waste management practices are aimed at reduction, resource recovery, reuse and recycling and off-site disposal in compliance with regulatory provisions. All manufacturing sites are ISO 14001 certified, which helps in adopting sound waste
management procedures. For management of hazardous waste, 'Authorisation' from State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) is duly obtained and the conditions therein are fully complied with. The provisions of the "Hazardous

and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016" are also fully followed. It is ensured that the waste generated is internally utilised to the maximum extent and the recyclable waste is disposed through authorised reprocessors for recovery of valuable resources. Agreements with cement plants to dispose waste for co-processing in their plants as Alternate Fuel and Raw Material (AFR) are in place.
All manufacturing sites are members of Common Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility (CHWTSDF), where the remaining hazardous waste is disposed. The non-hazardous waste generated at manufacturing site is disposed through registered parties for recycle and recovery of resources. Other non-hazardous waste is disposed in a scientific, environmentally sound manner and by adopting
good practices.

RIL has both formal and informal channels in place for engaging with its communities. At all its manufacturing sites, the Corporate Affairs Department personnel engages with the local communities and ensures that the Company's business operations are carried out having regard to the needs of the communities and keeping the larger objective of community welfare in mind. Reliance ensures that a significant number of the contractors and workmen employed by us are from the local communities. Grievances are received through the Company's Corporate Affairs Team, and these are appropriately addressed through both the local and corporate-level leadership teams. Communication can also be shared via verbal channels, e-mails, telephonic conversations, and

meetings. All grievances are taken seriously and there is a transparent process through which the resolutions are communicated both externally and internally to key stakeholders.
Additionally, RIL vendor partners are facilitated by a grievance redressal mechanism (SevaFirst Portal) wherein they can take up issues pertaining to various domains
of supply chain (payment, vendor configuration issues, among others) with appropriate channel for timely resolution. Further, the grievances received are tracked to their completion status regularly.
